# bend-kit

Packages for Bend 2 that Base does not include. Each package has its own laws and its own hub version. Networking came first, so `http` and the packages under it are the most complete. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) is the backlog.

This project was called bend-net. The old hub names, `bend-net-*`, still resolve. They get no new versions.

## Install

You need [Bend 2.0.38 or newer](https://bend-lang.com/install.sh) and [Bun 1.4.2](https://bun.sh/docs/installation). macOS or Linux, including WSL. Windows is not supported.

```bend
import Base
import bend-kit-bytes@0.3.3.0/bytes.bend as Bytes

def show(r: Bytes.Bytes & U32) -> IO(Unit):
  (b, n) = r
  IO.print(U32.show(n) ++ " " ++ Bytes.to_string(b))

def main() -> IO(Unit):
  show(Bytes.length(Bytes.from_string("hi")))
```

`bend` fetches that import and checks it against the published hash. `bend-kit-bytes@0.3.3.0` is `0x632652e3c1c0183f12728faf3870bb68`. A name and its hash are the same package. A different version is a different type.

The kit is in alpha. Types, names, and entry points can change. There is no compatibility shim. A break raises the second number of `VERSION`, from `0.3.0.0` to `0.4.0.0`, and the packages that import it move with it.

## Proofs

Each package has `LAWS.bend` and `PROOF.bend`. In that folder, `bend PROOF.bend` prints `All terms check.` when every law holds. Proofs do not cover `.c` and `.js` effects. Those effects run host code.

## Same type

Import the version the callee imports when you pass it a value. The newest folder version is often a different type. Each package README names the pins in its entry file.

`http@0.38.0.0` imports its siblings by name: `wire@0.4.6.2`, `http2@0.4.0.0`, `bytes@0.3.3.0`, `time@0.3.0.0`, `int@0.2.0.0`, `concurrency@0.2.0.0`, `url@0.4.1.0`, `encoding@0.5.0.0`, `json@0.7.0.0`, `dns@0.7.0.0`, and `zlib@0.4.0.0`. `Http.Body` is `bend-kit-bytes@0.3.3.0`.

`hairpin@0.13.0.0`, `camber@0.15.0.0`, `jwt@0.11.0.0`, `llm@0.13.0.0`, `oauth2@0.11.0.0`, `sigv4@0.11.0.0`, and `webhooks@0.11.0.0` import `bend-kit-http@0.38.0.0`, and all but `camber` import `bend-kit-hairpin@0.13.0.0`. A program that uses these versions together carries one copy of each C effect.

## Native libraries

The effects load these libraries at run time. Set the override when the library is not on the default search path. On macOS, `brew install openssl@3` covers TLS and crypto.

| Library | Used by | Override |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSSL 3 `libssl` | `wire` TLS, HTTPS in `http` and `hairpin` | `BEND_LIBSSL` |
| OpenSSL 3 `libcrypto` | `crypto`, and signing or secure random through it | `BEND_LIBCRYPTO` |
| `libsqlite3` | `sqlite` | `BEND_LIBSQLITE` |
| `libz` | `zlib` inflate and gzip, `archive` DEFLATE, `http` gzip | `BEND_LIBZ` |
| `libzstd` | `zlib` and `http` zstd | `BEND_LIBZSTD` |
| `libbrotlidec` | `zlib` and `http` brotli | `BEND_LIBBROTLIDEC` |

`files`, `process`, `dns`, `time`, `random`, and `tty` call the OS through effects. They do not load one of those libraries. Proofs do not cover any of these effects.

## Calling the packages

A `Socket`, `File`, `Cursor`, or `Client` is used once. The call returns the handle beside the result. Pass that handle on.

Octet buffers are `Bytes`: four octets in each `U32`. Use `String` for short text, such as header fields, paths, URLs, and code points.

`match` takes a parameter, not a computed value. Match a `Result` in a helper.

A body over about 30 KB overflows `bend file.bend`. Build it with `bend file.bend -o app`.

Each package README has the import, one example, and the limits that change the call. `bench/README.md` records timings. CI does not run benches.

For TOML 1.0, use [Emerging-Patterns/eztoml](https://github.com/Emerging-Patterns/eztoml) (`0xd79254973edee82bcf56616220876efe/main.bend`, v0.5.0). For CLI arguments, use [shake](https://github.com/Emerging-Patterns/shake).

## Layout

Each package is one folder. The folder name is the package name.

```
<package>/
  <package>.bend   entry file; its first comment line is the hub description
  VERSION          the hub version; CI publishes it on merge to main
  LAWS.bend        the claims
  PROOF.bend       a proof of each claim
  check.bend       native examples, when the package has them
  effs/            .c and .js effects, when the package has them
  bench/           timings, run by hand
```

`http/smoke.bend` does live fetches. `llm/smoke.bend`, `postgres/smoke.bend`, and `redis/smoke.bend` talk to a live service when their keys or server are set.

## Checks

```sh
scripts/check.sh              # every package
scripts/check.sh bytes http   # some packages
scripts/packages.sh origin/main
```

`check.sh` type-checks the entry file, then runs `PROOF.bend` and `check.bend`. CI checks each package a pull request changes. A change under `.github/` or `scripts/`, and each push to `main`, checks every package. A package with `effs/*.c`, and `webhooks`, also runs `scripts/native-check.sh`. `scripts/pins.sh` fails a pull request whose changed packages import a sibling at a version other than its `VERSION`, or by hash; `scripts/pins.allow` lists the exceptions. It also fails when this README names a changed package at a version other than its `VERSION`.

CI installs the Bend version pinned in `scripts/install-bend.sh`. To move to a new Bend, change `VER` and `SHA` in that script.

On each push to `main`, a package that passes its checks is published as `bend-kit-<package>@<VERSION>` unless that version is already on the hub. If the hub has that version with different files, the job fails and `VERSION` must rise. Pull requests run `scripts/publish.sh --check` and publish nothing.
