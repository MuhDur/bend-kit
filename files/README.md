# files

POSIX paths, directory listing, metadata, and packed file IO.

```bend
import bend-kit-files@0.3.1.0/files.bend as Fs
import bend-kit-bytes@0.3.3.0/bytes.bend as Bytes
```

`path.is_absolute`, `path.join`, `path.normalize`, `path.parent`, `path.file_name`, and `path.extension` are pure. They do not touch the disk. `path.join` does not insert a slash that the arguments already imply. Check the result before you pass it to an effect.

Effects return `Result<&1, &1, U32 & String, _>`. The error pair contains errno and text. File IO effects return the `File` handle beside the result. Pass that handle to the next operation.

```bend
def main() -> IO(Unit):
  do IO<Unit>:
    dir : String <- IO.try(String, Fs.temp_dir())
    IO.print(dir)
```

`IO.try` returns the value from `Done` and fails the `IO` on `Fail`. Match the `Result` in a helper when you need errno. `match` takes a parameter or a pattern-bound variable.


`read_bytes(file, max)` and `write_bytes(file, data)` use `Bytes`. This package imports `bend-kit-bytes@0.3.3.0`. `read.words` reads at most 1 MiB per call. A short read does not always mean EOF. `write.words` writes the whole buffer or fails. It does not undo bytes already written.

`size64(file)` gives the size of an open file as `(hi, lo)`, which is `hi * 2^32 + lo` bytes. `read.words.at(file, hi, lo, max)` reads like `read.words`, at that byte offset. It does not move the file position. Use them for files over 4 GiB.

`stat` follows symbolic links. `Info.size` and `Info.mtime` are `U32`. `mtime` is whole seconds since the Unix epoch. Both wrap at 2^32. `mkdir_all` creates each missing component. It fails if a component exists but is not a directory. `temp_dir` creates a new private directory under the system temp directory.

The effects are `effs/files.c` and `effs/files.js`. Proofs do not cover them.
