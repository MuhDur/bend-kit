# HTTP benchmarks

## Codec

`bench.*` and `rs/` time the HTTP/1.1 codec with no socket: parse one fixed request and one fixed response, and encode one of each. Bend runs against C, Rust, JavaScript (Bun and Node), and Python.

### Run

```sh
python3 run.py      # 3 runs per variant, median
python3 run.py 5    # 5 runs
```

You need `bend`, `clang`, `llhttp` (`brew install llhttp`), `cargo`, `bun`, `node`, and `uv`. Cargo fetches `httparse` and `uv` fetches `h11` on the first run. Binaries go to `out/`, which git ignores. The run takes about 30 seconds. It exits non-zero if a build fails, or if two languages print different checksums for one op.

### Input

Each op runs 20,000 times on one message:

| op | message |
|---|---|
| `parse_req` | a 451-byte `POST` with 9 browser-like headers and a 26-byte JSON body |
| `parse_res` | a 252-byte `200` with 6 headers and a 34-byte JSON body |
| `encode_req` | a `POST` with 3 caller headers and the 26-byte body, 222 bytes out |
| `encode_res` | a `200` with 4 caller headers and the 34-byte body, 200 bytes out |

The parse checksum sums, over every message, the method and target lengths (for a request) or the status code (for a response), plus name length + value length + 1 per header, plus the body length. Bend's encoders add `host`, `connection`, and `content-length`, and write headers in sorted order, so the other encoders get the same headers. h11 moves `host` first, so the encode checksum sums a hash per line (`h = h*31 + c`, u32) and does not depend on line order. It adds the total output length. The checksums are `8200000`, `8300000`, `954665139`, and `4171655946`, in table order.

### Results

M4 Pro, macOS 26.6.2, 2026-09-27. Median of three runs. Times are in ms for 20,000 messages; `Nx` is the multiple of the fastest variant for that op.

| op | C | Rust | Bun | Node | Python | Bend |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| parse_req | 3.7 (2.2x) | 1.7 (1.0x) | 17.3 (10.2x) | 21.0 (12.4x) | 460.7 (271.0x) | 493.9 (290.5x) |
| parse_res | 2.3 (1.6x) | 1.4 (1.0x) | 12.6 (9.0x) | 15.8 (11.3x) | 324.4 (231.7x) | 423.9 (302.8x) |
| encode_req | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 371.7 (1.9x) | 190.8 (1.0x) |
| encode_res | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 277.4 (2.1x) | 132.6 (1.0x) |

Versions: Bend 2.0.31, Apple clang 17.0.0 with llhttp 9.4.2, rustc 1.91.0 with httparse 1.10.1, Bun 1.3.14, Node 24.0.1, Python 3.14.6 with h11 0.16.0.

### HTTP 0.27.0.0 verification

`python3 http/bench/run.py` from the repository root passed on the arm64 macOS
workstation with Bend 2.0.35. Three-run medians for the unchanged 20,000-message
codec workload were:

| op | C | Rust | Bun | Node | Python | Bend |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| parse_req | 3.7 | 1.6 | 18.0 | 21.5 | 457.9 | 532.1 |
| parse_res | 2.3 | 1.4 | 12.6 | 16.3 | 323.4 | 442.9 |
| encode_req | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 325.6 | 198.0 |
| encode_res | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 280.8 | 134.2 |

Times are milliseconds, not a transport throughput claim. Matching checksums
were `8200000`, `8300000`, `954665139`, and `4171655946`. The guarded runner
completed in 18.412 seconds; peak sampled descendant RSS was 1,956,240 KiB.
The full receipt is retained in `../limits_verification.json`. No claim of
improvement over historical measurements or Camber application performance is made.

### HTTP 0.28.0.0 verification

`python3 -B http/bench/run.py` passed sequentially in the exclusive compiler slot
on the arm64 macOS workstation with Bend 2.0.35. Three-run medians, in milliseconds
for the same 20,000-message codec workload:

| op | C | Rust | Bun | Node | Python | Bend |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| parse_req | 3.6 | 1.8 | 17.0 | 20.0 | 446.9 | 525.7 |
| parse_res | 2.3 | 1.5 | 12.5 | 15.0 | 316.9 | 434.3 |
| encode_req | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 317.2 | 195.7 |
| encode_res | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 272.1 | 131.8 |

All six parsers agreed on `8200000` and `8300000`; the available Python/Bend
encoders agreed on `954665139` and `4171655946`. The other encode rows remain n/a.
The guarded run took 17.875 seconds; peak sampled aggregate descendant RSS was
2,466,784 KiB. [`../admission_verification.json`](../admission_verification.json)
keeps the full receipt. These are codec measurements, not admission throughput,
an improvement claim, or Camber application performance.

### HTTP 0.29.0.0 verification

`python3 -B http/bench/run.py` passed all six parser variants and the available
Python/Bend encoders with unchanged checksums `8200000`, `8300000`, `954665139`,
and `4171655946`. Three-run medians in milliseconds for 20,000 messages:

| op | C | Rust | Bun | Node | Python | Bend |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| parse_req | 3.8 | 1.7 | 17.0 | 20.7 | 451.4 | 525.1 |
| parse_res | 2.3 | 1.4 | 12.1 | 15.6 | 324.4 | 436.0 |
| encode_req | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 318.7 | 195.5 |
| encode_res | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 276.6 | 132.2 |

The guarded command took 18.256 seconds and sampled 2,461,744 KiB aggregate
descendant RSS. Native/JS migrated raw/lifecycle serving benchmark boundaries
also compiled; no application throughput comparison was rerun or claimed.
[`../outcome_verification.json`](../outcome_verification.json) retains full
commands, outputs, and adverse receipts. Historical measurements remain intact.

### HTTP 0.30.0.0 verification

`python3 -B http/bench/run.py` passed sequentially in the exclusive verification
slot. The unchanged checksums were `8200000`, `8300000`, `954665139`, and
`4171655946`. Three-run medians in milliseconds for 20,000 messages:

| op | C | Rust | Bun | Node | Python | Bend |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| parse_req | 3.6 | 1.6 | 17.4 | 20.2 | 453.0 | 530.2 |
| parse_res | 2.3 | 1.4 | 12.6 | 15.6 | 317.3 | 439.0 |
| encode_req | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 323.0 | 196.7 |
| encode_res | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 275.8 | 132.6 |

The guarded run took 18.115 seconds and sampled 2,588,464 KiB aggregate
descendant RSS. Native/JS raw and scoped lifecycle boundaries also compiled
and ran ten text dispatches with checksum `2030`; that is a smoke check,
not an application throughput comparison. [`../drain_verification.json`](../drain_verification.json)
retains commands, failures, proof exclusions, and prior regression journals.
Historical performance and failed lifecycle evidence remain unchanged.

### The calls

| language | parse | encode |
|---|---|---|
| Bend | `Http.parse`, `Http.parse_res` | `Http.encode_req`, `Http.encode` |
| C | `llhttp_execute` with span callbacks | left out |
| Rust | `httparse::Request::parse`, `httparse::Response::parse`, then the `Content-Length` body slice | left out |
| JavaScript | `HTTPParser.execute` from Node's `_http_common` | left out |
| Python | `h11.Connection.receive_data` and `next_event` | `h11.Connection.send` |

C, Rust, and JavaScript have no HTTP/1.1 message encoder short of a client or server bound to a socket, so they have no encode rows. The JavaScript parser is Node's own llhttp binding. Its module is legacy and not documented, but Node and Bun both ship it.

### Caveats

- httparse reads only the head, so the Rust variant finds `Content-Length` and slices the body itself.
- h11 reads a response only on a connection that has sent a request, and writes one only on a connection that has read one. `bench.py` makes those 20,000 connections before the timer starts.
- C, Rust, and JavaScript reuse one parser. Python makes a connection per message. Bend has no parser state.
- Bend strings are lists, one cell per byte. The others read flat buffers.
- Bend times itself with `Time.mono`, a nanosecond clock.
- These are micro-benchmarks on one machine.


### Parse phase breakdown (Bend native)

`parse_phases.bend` times `Http.parse` stages in isolation on the same 20,000×451-byte request as the codec bench (one native run, ms for the whole loop):

```sh
cd http/bench && bend parse_phases.bend -o out/parse_phases && ./out/parse_phases
```

| phase | ms (2026-09-26) | what it measures |
|---|---:|---|
| full | 480 | `Http.parse` |
| split | 64 | `split_at_blank` |
| whole | 68 | split, then `blank_end` on the head |
| lines | 184 | split, then `String.lines` |
| start_line | 194 | lines, then the first line → method/path/version |
| field_ops | 243 | lines, then per header line: `drop_cr`, `split_colon` (lower inline), `trim` |
| map_build | 417 | lines, then `parse.headers` → `Map` |
| head_got | 477 | `parse.got` through head (no body rules) |
| body_len | 453 | `map_build`, then body length / hold |

Each row after `split` includes the rows it builds on. The `Map` build (about 175 ms) and `String.lines` (about 120 ms) are now the largest costs. `String.ends_with`, `String.trim_end`, and the old `drop_cr` each made a reversed copy; the single-pass versions removed most of the time they took.

The 2026-09-29 header scan consumes lines as it builds the map instead of making
`String.lines`' intermediate list. On one M4 Pro phase run, `full` changed from
554 ms to 508 ms for 20,000 requests. The codec benchmark (five-run median)
measured 607 ms for `parse_req` and 476 ms for `parse_res`, with the same
checksums as C, Rust, JavaScript, and Python. Phase times and codec times are
separate runs; do not compare their absolute values.

## Network

`fetch16.bend` and `serve16.bend` time a live download and upload in Bend only. They measure the socket and the runtime along with the codec. See the comment at the top of each file.

```sh
bend fetch16.bend -o out/fetch16 && /usr/bin/time -l out/fetch16 http://127.0.0.1:18094/cl
bend serve16.bend -o out/serve16 && out/serve16 &
curl -s -w ' %{time_total}\n' --data-binary @16m.bin http://127.0.0.1:18093/
```

The download server is a local Python `http.server` that sends 12 MiB (byte `i` is `i % 251`), either with `Content-Length` or as 64 KiB chunks. The upload is 16 MiB of random bytes. Each program prints the body length, which is the checksum: `12582912` and `16777216`.

M4 Pro, macOS 26.6.2, Bend 2.0.29, 2026-09-26. Median of 15 downloads and 7 uploads. The time is in-process for a download and `curl` total for an upload. Peak RSS is from `/usr/bin/time -l`.

| run | http 0.15.0.4 | http 0.15.0.5 |
|---|---:|---:|
| download, Content-Length | 8 ms, 31.6 MB | 7 ms, 19.0 MB |
| download, chunked | 10 ms, 31.9 MB | 12 ms, 33.1 MB |
| upload, Content-Length | 7.8 ms, 35.9 MB | 7.9 ms, 35.9 MB |

0.15.0.5 writes a Content-Length response body into one buffer as it arrives. Chunked downloads and uploads take the same code path in both versions, so their differences are noise.

### Stream opens

`streams.bend` opens 200 small streams to one origin and reads each to its end. It runs them first with `Http.open`, which dials a new connection for each stream, as every stream did before `http` 0.37.0.0. Then it runs them with `Http.pool.open` and `Http.pool.stream.close` on one pool. `keepalive.py` is a local Python keep-alive server that answers each `GET` with a 64-byte `Content-Length` body. Each run prints the bytes read, which is the checksum: `12800` for both.

```sh
python3 keepalive.py 18095 &
bend streams.bend -o out/streams && out/streams http://127.0.0.1:18095/
```

M4 Pro, macOS 26.6.2, Bend 2.0.38, 2026-10-23. Median of 5 runs, in ms for 200 streams, over plain HTTP on loopback. TLS would add a handshake to each new connection, so the gap grows over TLS.

| run | ms |
|---|---:|
| new connection each (`open`) | 25.7 |
| one pool (`pool.open`) | 11.5 |

This bench is Bend only, like the other network benches. It compares the two Bend paths.
