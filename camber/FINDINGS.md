# Camber design validation

Date: 2026-10-02. These are experiment findings, not guarantees of an implemented or published Camber package. The user-approved [SPEC](SPEC.md) now targets a dedicated supervised server process and is included in [PR #315](https://github.com/paymog/bend-kit/pull/315).

## Verdict

The application-layer design fits Bend when reusable configuration and route descriptions are `Data`, execution is supplied through closed templates, and affine resources move through request work explicitly. A copied callback registry does not fit that model. The typed/scoped application now runs through finite real-socket transport in both lanes. Its behavior contract is coherent, but public interface ergonomics and production serving remain unproved.

Native direct overhead passed the frozen allowances in all 18 paired controls. A tighter five-workload recheck passed all native comparison gates, but three Bend-on-Bun direct overhead failures persisted. Historical routing, strict JSON, and cancellation probes found blockers under the earlier contract. Prepared routing now corrects the routing gaps below; strict JSON remains unresolved. The user removed runtime cancellation and embedded lifecycle isolation from the release contract, not from the recorded observations. Loopback throughput is measured; production capacity, complete-framework overhead, and release safety are not established.

## Design risks, in priority order

The lifecycle experiments ran sequentially in native and Bun/JavaScript lanes with Bend 2.0.34. Run `python3 -B camber/run_risks.py`. [design_risk_results.json](design_risk_results.json) retains every calibration and final scenario. These are boundary probes, not a serving implementation or a passing SPEC gate.

| Priority | Risk | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Dedicated-process lifecycle | External termination works in the probes; integrated graceful drain and supervisor deployment remain unproved |
| 2 | Resource recovery and transport lifecycle | Affine ownership does not establish descriptor cleanup or socket teardown |
| 3 | Composition and agent authoring | Typed/scoped mechanisms work; reliable agent use and duplication-free registration remain unproved |
| 4 | Performance | Large-body transport risk and JS overhead failures remain; complete-framework costs are unknown |

### 1. Cancellation and containment

The candidate forced operation is Base `IO.die(Unit, 1, ...)`, invoked by spawned work after a 100 ms timer. It halts the whole program, not just server-owned work. With a sleeping worker, the halt marker arrived after 101 ms native and 113 ms JS. Neither worker explicitly closed its File, and unrelated work scheduled to write after 500 ms did not complete. This failed the earlier embedded-shutdown requirement, which the user has now removed. Runtime-crash containment is not promised by R6.8.

Pure CPU work was calibrated to at least 300 ms before testing its interaction with that timer:

| Lane | Iterations | Calibration | Timer to halt marker | Journal |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Native, one runtime thread | 512,000,000 | 488 ms | 498 ms | `committed` then `late` |
| Bun/JavaScript | 128,000,000 | 807 ms | 823 ms | `committed` then `late` |

Both exceed the scaled 100 ms timer plus 100 ms forced-teardown allowance. Both perform the late write before halt. Native did not emit the explicit-close marker; JS did. These scaled experiments are not a measurement of the SPEC's default 5-second grace plus 1-second teardown. They show that this same-runtime timer is not a demonstrated hard interruption boundary for noncooperating pure work.

A cooperative worker blocked on a stop channel returns its File when the owner closes that channel. The owner joins and closes the File before unrelated work finishes successfully. The journal contains only `committed`. This validates one cooperative protocol, not cancellation of arbitrary handlers or pending socket effects. The earlier timeout/late-write failures remain unchanged and were not rerun.

The initial CPU fixture never reached its calibration floor and completed work before halt. Its [initial observations](design_risk_initial_results.json) remain retained, but are not CPU-interruption evidence. The final fixture uses a runtime-generated seed after the begin marker and larger inputs to keep the measured work inside the observation boundary.

The `process` package also has a separate capability defect. A minimal `Process.exit(77)` using the published hash exits 1 with `bend: an alien request` in native. Its JS build fails before main with `no effect registers .../process.exit.raw`. The relative native import failed too: emitted `CID____PROCESS_PROCESS_EXIT_RAW` does not match the adapter's literal registration guards. [process_exit_risk_results.json](process_exit_risk_results.json) retains those failures and the minimal source. The current effects guide requires namespace-aware `CID(name)` registration; these legacy adapters do not use it. This is adapter compatibility evidence, not an established compiler defect or a supported process-exit implementation.

#### Upstream boundary and external supervision

This is not an assumed pending runtime feature. Upstream [#1034](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/issues/1034#issuecomment-5857296248) was closed after adding the deadline race; cancellation of the losing blocking effect was explicitly excluded. Bend 2.0.34's [WONTFIX](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/WONTFIX.txt) lists that exclusion under capacity limits. The `v2.0.34` tag resolves to source revision `7d8a3eb036042c6549461054d25a10f26d361c5c`.

The [native scheduler](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/bend2/comp.ts#L5970-L6010) evaluates a continuation synchronously before handling its next IO request; a Halt calls process `exit`. The [JS scheduler](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/bend2/comp.ts#L6416-L6455) invokes continuations synchronously and returns from the whole IO runner on Halt. Pure work therefore can delay reaching the timer continuation. The runtime does not expose a server-owned cancellation/cleanup control through Base spawn or fork.

Run `python3 -B camber/run_supervision.py`. It reuses the retained CPU iteration counts, runs a dedicated Bend child, and sends OS `SIGKILL` after a 100 ms host-side delay. [supervision_risk_results.json](supervision_risk_results.json) retains all four observations:

| Lane | CPU signal to child reaping | Idle-socket signal to child reaping | Idle peer closes | Unrelated parent work |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Native | 1.309 ms | 1.333 ms | yes | completes |
| Bun/JavaScript | 3.595 ms | 1.294 ms | yes | completes |

The CPU worker has not emitted its end marker when killed. Both journals retain only `committed`; the later write does not occur. The idle peer observes closure after termination. No explicit File-close marker appears. The surviving unrelated work is an actual Python-parent task, not a computation embedded in the terminated Bend process. Recorded overall wall time includes waiting for that parent work; signal-to-reap time measures child termination.

This proves an external termination boundary for these dedicated-process workloads, not real-time OS scheduling, graceful drain, restart safety, descendant cleanup, or an implemented Bend supervisor. On 2026-10-02 the user explicitly chose dedicated-process serving and dropped embedded lifecycle isolation and preemptive handler cancellation. R7.4/R7.5 now permit an external supervisor to terminate the whole server process after grace expires. These probes support that fallback boundary, but do not establish the full serving contract or its default shutdown budgets.

The deployment must document its external supervisor, shutdown trigger, grace period, forced-termination action, and observed process exit. Cooperative work still returns its affine instances for explicit cleanup. Forced termination may skip cleanup, flushes, and completion notifications; remote side effects may outlive the process. Timeouts and disconnects do not release a dependency still held by running work. Direct dispatch remains supported without promising an independently stoppable embedded server.


### 2. Affine-resource recovery and transport lifecycle

After a worker sends its actual File into a closed result channel, `Chan.send` reports false and the worker finishes. `lsof` still finds that File's descriptor in the live process in both lanes. The probe stays alive for inspection, then exits naturally. Erasing the affine result is not observed File cleanup. A timeout or shutdown design must preserve an owner and a recovery path rather than drop the resource-bearing reply.

Closing the finite transport's listener refuses new connections in both lanes. An already accepted idle socket and the process remain alive 6.25 seconds later, beyond the SPEC's default combined shutdown budgets. Only after the client releases the socket does this fixture join the connection and close its File. This is not a shutdown invocation: it tests whether listener closure alone supplies the missing lifecycle behavior. It does not.

Source inspection identifies the shared seams: `Http.talk.after` loses the write outcome, the bundled fixture starts workers before `IO.try` on listen, and worker admission follows complete body framing. The follow-up runtime probes below exercise those paths. Their finite connection count and bounded job queue are not production T3 admission controls. Bind-result propagation and socket/write controls belong in `http`/`wire`; cleanup of opened application bundles belongs to their owner. Camber must not add a second transport.

#### Executed startup, admission, and write-outcome gates

Run `python3 -B camber/run_transport_risks.py`. [transport_risk_results.json](transport_risk_results.json) retains five scenarios in each lane: occupied-port startup, small and larger incomplete-body admission, healthy write, and reset-peer write. This validates current boundaries, not a public serving interface or passing transport contract.

| Gate | Observed in both lanes | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup bind failure | Store and audit files are created; exit code 48 and `Address already in use`; no READY or explicit bundle-close marker | Terminal diagnostics, not a returned startup result with logical resource cleanup |
| One held worker plus incomplete bodies | The small run has 3 live server endpoints; the larger run has 131 with one worker busy and 129 incomplete-body peers | Worker permits do not bound accepted sockets or pre-handler buffered work |
| Business overload and normal drain | Extra complete business request gets 503 without audit writes; release restores `busy=0`, then ordinary drain closes the bundle | Positive worker recovery, not forced shutdown or production admission |
| Healthy response write | Peer receives exact `200`/`ok`; raw IO result succeeds; public continuation is `TurnClose` | Closure does not identify successful write |
| Peer reset before response write | Actual IO result fails; the same public continuation is `TurnClose` | Failure is erased before completion reporting |

The bind-failure path is the existing `Live.start`: bundles open and workers start before `TCP.listen`, whose failure is passed through `IO.try`. This whole-program failure does not falsely signal listening. No explicit bundle-close marker appears before exit; OS process cleanup is not a resource-return protocol to an embedded owner. No live-process descriptor leak after exit is claimed.

The larger admission fixture deliberately calls the existing start helper with 132 lifetime accepts, rather than its original four-connection CLI horizon. `lsof` counts 131 actual established endpoints after the overload connection closes: held handler, control peer, and 129 incomplete-body peers. Each incomplete body declares 4,096 bytes and has sent 1,024. This exceeds the proposed 128-connection default, but that default is not configured or implemented in the fixture. It shows why the one-worker cap cannot supply T3. The measurements do not distinguish bytes in kernel receive queues from bytes already retained by Bend. Production `Http.conn` likewise spawns each accepted socket without an admission counter.

The write probe uses the same `Http.reply.bytes` and `Http.io.send.bytes` writer as `Http.talk.send`, observes its actual result, then passes that result through the existing `Http.talk.after` with non-keepalive policy. It adds only observation between writer and transition. Both success and real reset failure yield `TurnClose`, so the information is lost at that transition, not guessed from client disconnect. No completion-notification API was supplied or exercised. T5 must preserve the result before R6.7 can report it honestly.

The user initially kept cancellation blocked while these transport gates ran, then explicitly relaxed the contract to dedicated supervised serving. The raw observations remain unchanged. Runtime cancellation is no longer a release prerequisite; startup rollback, production connection/buffer limits, write-outcome reporting, notifications, and integrated graceful shutdown remain outstanding. Previous failure datasets and performance budgets remain unchanged.


### 3. Application composition and authoring

The retained direct and socket results support typed authentication, affine inputs, entered scopes, single-pass expected-error mapping, public sibling isolation, and plain packed-body handlers. They were not rerun to reconfirm known results. `author_app.bend` still needs explicit templates, quantity adapters, scope wrappers, metadata reconstruction, and a hardcoded route branch. The user prioritizes agent-understandable correctness and performance over concise authoring. Explicit annotations are acceptable; duplicate routing decisions and caller-managed lifecycle protocols are not. Same-author examples do not establish independent-author usability, and no independent author or subagent was used.

### 4. Performance

The retained external comparison shows 4 MiB Bend raw/scoped echo throughput of 72/75 requests/s, against 1,041 for axum, 692 for Fastify, and 806 for FastAPI. At 37/s, corrected Bend raw/scoped p99 is 166/110 ms, against about 11–13 ms for those controls. The minimal scoped/raw ratio does not explain that large gap by itself. Transport/body profiling is warranted; an exact bottleneck is not established.

The native tighter recheck passed its frozen gates, while JS direct overhead and one p99 failure persisted. These measurements predate prepared routing and do not price the full typed application. Generator sensitivity prevents a clean capacity ranking. No performance comparison was rerun or budget relaxed during this risk validation.

#### Progress under CPU load

Run `python3 -B camber/run_progress.py`. [progress_results.json](progress_results.json) retains 21 observations: one small-input control, three yielding controls, and three CPU trials per configuration. Each process serves two real HTTP peers through the existing finite `Transport.accept`/`Http.talk.send` path. A third peer sends incomplete headers to a separate actual `Wire.recv.words` read configured for 200 ms. The ordinary request is sent 25 ms after the host observes CPU_BEGIN. No application pool, business queue, or dependency checkout blocks that request.

| Configuration | Yielding-control ordinary latency | CPU-work duration | Ordinary latency during CPU work | Read arm to explicit socket close during CPU work |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native, `--threads 1 --gpu off` | 0.468 ms | 490.487 ms | 461.123 ms | 543.070 ms |
| Native, default CPU threads, `--gpu off` | 0.398 ms | 485.625 ms | 459.356 ms | 541.188 ms |
| Bun/JS | 1.719 ms | 815.229 ms | 787.146 ms | 874.853 ms |

These are medians of three trials, not tail percentiles or production capacity. The yielding worker sleeps for about 500 ms; ordinary handlers and timed socket closure progress before it finishes. Control read-arm-to-close medians are 204.000, 203.521, and 204.676 ms respectively. In all nine CPU trials, the first ordinary handler and timed socket closure occur only after CPU_END. Every case receives exact `200` bodies, the partial peer sees EOF, recovery requests succeed, and the process exits naturally. Recovery latency after CPU completion ranges from 0.144–0.175 ms for native single-thread, 0.124–0.188 ms for default native threads, and 0.592–0.726 ms for JS in the CPU trials.

The CPU input is runtime-seeded serial arithmetic, reusing the earlier calibrated iteration counts: 512 million native and 128 million JS. It is not a measured JSON-decoder or real application workload. The native default-thread case changes the CPU-thread setting, not the workload into parallel code. GPU work is disabled. Raising CPU threads did not make these IO computations independently progress.

This is shared event-loop head-of-line blocking, consistent with `bend guide`: each computation evaluates pure code up to its next effect. The tagged [native IO step](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/bend2/comp.ts#L5970-L6010) calls `corpus_eval` synchronously; the [JS runner](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/bend2/comp.ts#L6416-L6455) likewise runs continuations synchronously. It is not evidence of a new compiler bug, dependency deadlock, or Camber hook overhead.

The timed read reports actual error 60, `Operation timed out`, in every case. We observe error delivery and explicit socket closure, not the instant the host timeout expires internally. The partial peer confirms client-visible closure, whose timestamp is retained separately. This does not test an absolute HTTP header deadline or a `408` response; those production controls remain missing. It shows that a configured IO timeout does not by itself bound the subsequent same-runtime reaction while pure work occupies the event loop.

Dedicated-process supervision still supplies a termination fallback, not responsiveness. The bounded JSON investigation below measures real parsing and application validation. Consider bounded compute chunks with explicit yielding, measured nonblocking native effects, or separate execution for justified heavy work. None of these mitigations was implemented or validated here. Preserve admission accounting while work remains active, and do not assume more CPU threads or worker channels solve the observed scheduling behavior.

#### Progress during real JSON parsing and validation

Run `python3 -B camber/run_json_progress.py`. [json_progress_results.json](json_progress_results.json) retains 126 corrected observations: 14 workloads, three trials each, in native single/default CPU-thread and Bun/JS configurations. Every process starts fresh. Both native configurations reuse one compiled binary. The fixture consumes actual HTTP bodies through the existing packed transport, then calls the existing `Json.parse.bytes` or `Users.name`. It does not implement another parser or model validator.

Inputs include a valid 1 KiB name request, exactly 100 Unicode code points, 64 KiB and 1 MiB strings, dense numeric arrays, objects with unique keys, escaped strings, a depth-64 document, oversized names that the application must reject, and malformed JSON with its invalid byte at the end of a 1 MiB body. All bodies fit the proposed 1 MiB cap. This is an adverse bounded corpus, not an exhaustive worst-case proof.

Selected medians in milliseconds. Each cell is **work / ordinary-request latency**:

| Workload | Native, one CPU thread | Native, default CPU threads | Bun/JS |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Valid 1 KiB name | 0.049 / 0.228 | 0.048 / 0.542 | 2.519 / 7.896 |
| 1 MiB JSON string | 0.862 / 1.070 | 1.531 / 2.187 | 100.773 / 110.868 |
| 1 MiB dense numeric array | 25.780 / 26.421 | 28.241 / 28.904 | 548.401 / 558.264 |
| 1 MiB object with unique keys | 9.038 / 9.394 | 10.203 / 10.349 | 175.340 / 179.955 |
| 1 MiB oversized name, rejected | 23.684 / 24.337 | 25.313 / 25.920 | 218.041 / 231.221 |
| Small depth-64 document | 0.074 / 0.810 | 0.065 / 0.287 | 1.782 / 4.905 |

The same actual 200 ms Wire read runs beside the work. It starts after the body is fully framed, so upload/framing cannot consume its budget before parsing starts. A 50 ms release delay lets the timed read arm first. Ordinary requests are sent 1 ms after the host sees CPU_BEGIN.

| Workload | Native single: read arm to close | Native default: read arm to close | Bun/JS: read arm to close |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 MiB dense numeric array | 203.256 ms | 205.291 ms | 610.299 ms |
| 1 MiB object with unique keys | 205.393 ms | 202.903 ms | 231.625 ms |
| 1 MiB oversized name | 203.965 ms | 203.076 ms | 284.202 ms |

All 126 corrected cases return the exact expected workload, ordinary, and recovery responses. Oversized names and malformed JSON return `400`; accepted inputs return `200`. Every actual timed read reports the host's `ETIMEDOUT` (60 here), the partial peer sees EOF, and the process exits naturally with status 0. The largest sampled runtime RSS is 37.563 MiB native single, 37.688 MiB native default, and 329.922 MiB JS. Sampling is not a kernel peak. Maximum observed recovery latency is 4.237, 1.874, and 31.234 ms respectively.

**Timing correction:** native stdout is buffered. The [native flush helper](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/bend2/comp.ts#L5573-L5583) is called [before the IO loop waits](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/blob/v2.0.34/bend2/comp.ts#L5806-L5816). The host can receive CPU_BEGIN and CPU_END together after a short computation. The first hypothesis of early pure evaluation was not confirmed; adding a body channel alone did not fix marker delivery. [The initial run](json_progress_initial_results.json) and [body-channel-only run](json_progress_channel_results.json) retain all 252 earlier observations with that limitation. Their native marker deltas and scheduled overlap are not used for the corrected conclusions.

The retained fixture now pauses 1 ms immediately after CPU_BEGIN, before any parsing, so native stdout can flush while all work is parked. It receives the affine body from a one-shot channel after the internal start clock. `Time.mono` measures work until the result is constructed, independently of host log arrival. Work includes that body transfer, parsing or name validation, value disposal, and the tiny response construction; it excludes the pre-work pause and network response write. No yielding is added inside the parser. Host marker durations remain in the data but are not the work-time column above. Two additional native/JS small-input smokes confirm the original synthetic fixture still works through the extended shared interaction helper. The final errno assertion was also checked against all retained corrected observations without repeating the runtime suite.

**Interpretation:** a single default-limit request can delay an ordinary request about 26–29 ms natively and over half a second in JS for this dense array. Native default CPU threads do not remove serial parse work. Native cases in this corpus finish before the 200 ms read budget; JS dense arrays exceed it. The oversized-name path also converts the entire decoded byte string and walks its length before rejecting the 100-code-point bound (`Users.name.value`). That is a measured optimization candidate, not a changed validation policy.

This is not a full Camber decoder, strict-JSON conformance, sustained/burst capacity, or a production deadline gate. In-parse depth enforcement, unpaired-surrogate rejection, and nested repeated-key validation remain required. Small controls can finish before an ordinary request arrives; their rows are baselines, not concurrent-progress guarantees. Exact public output contents, storage effects, and response encoding of a large tree are not measured by the parse-only route. The raw read observes result delivery, explicit closure, and peer EOF, not internal expiry or an absolute HTTP phase deadline.

The native result permits continued design validation; it does not justify calling the scheduling risk harmless. Keep the unfavorable JS result. Next measure aggregate/burst work and shared transport/body costs before selecting limits or an execution strategy. Do not infer production capacity from three fresh-process trials.



## External framework performance comparison

The [benchmark report](bench/README.md) and [all retained samples](bench/frameworks/results.json) compare native Bend raw/scoped controls with Hyper/axum, Node HTTP/Fastify, and plain ASGI/FastAPI on Uvicorn. All eight variants passed 19 workloads with three closed-loop and three corrected fixed-rate trials each: 912 measured trials, with no transport errors or unexpected statuses and exact aggregate response bytes.

Bend scoped fixed text measured about 24k requests/s, versus axum 107k, Fastify 80k, and FastAPI 22k. The scoped/raw throughput ratio is 0.93–1.19 across the corpus. Four-MiB echoes expose a larger gap: Bend scoped about 75/s versus axum 1,041/s, Fastify 692/s, and FastAPI 806/s. At the common 37/s rate, Bend scoped corrected p99 is about 110 ms versus 11–13 ms for the other controls.

These are exploratory loopback observations, not production capacity or complete Camber overhead. Generator scaling changes Hyper throughput materially, and longer focused measurements retain large swings. Client CPU and scheduling still matter; no non-limiting generator claim is made. Fastify beats the simple Node adapter in most cells, while FastAPI loses throughput at 1,000 literal routes. Neither difference isolates pure framework overhead. The report records feature and routing differences, CPU/RSS definitions, all trial data, and unstable tails.

The next performance investigation should profile native HTTP transport/body work. The comparison predates the prepared-router cutover; its measured source revision is `f441c13`, and its datasets remain unchanged. It does not resolve strict JSON or production serving gaps. The later user-approved lifecycle scope change does not alter these measurements or human-owned laws.

## Prepared router prerequisite

The shared `router` now prepares and validates route descriptions before dispatch. Camber's reusable plans and scoped fixture use that table; the superseded callback-free list selector is removed. This is the local breaking `router` release `0.2.0.0`, pending merge and CI publication, not a published Camber API.

Selection is path-first and independent of registration order. The table rejects duplicate method/shape pairs and conflicting ancestry, preserves each method's capture names, exposes hidden methods, and supplies explicit/generated HEAD and OPTIONS plus sorted Allow sets. Targets retain exact slashes and case, decode segments once with strict UTF-8, preserve ordered repeated query fields, and reject invalid targets. Absolute-form authority replaces application Host.

Generated 405 and OPTIONS enter the selected group but skip route hooks, decoding, and business work. Group authorization and early responses still apply. `OPTIONS *` enters only the root scope. The reusable executor now receives the selected capture map; lookup no longer reparses the target or repeats method selection. Direct HEAD retains the GET body, while socket transport suppresses it.

Runtime evidence in both native and JavaScript lanes:

- `run_surface.py`: 47 direct cases; `run_surface_live.py`: 51 socket scenarios, including grouped method outcomes, invalid targets, HEAD, absolute/encoded paths, journal invariants, queued work, disconnects, and packed plain-handler bodies. New socket observations are retained in [router_surface_live_results.json](router_surface_live_results.json); the earlier dataset remains unchanged.
- `run_ownership.py`: ownership and reusable-plan checks; the reusable fixture also covers HEAD lookup, absolute-form encoded lookup with repeated query fields, and an encoded static route.
- `run_live.py`: all four bundled scenarios, with the route scenario extended for absolute-form HEAD lookup and encoded static selection.
- Prepared-router assertions pass in the checker and native/JavaScript builds. The unchanged entry/proof gates pass. A throwaway real-handler smoke observed `Host: example.test:8080` instead of the supplied `wrong.test` in both lanes.
- The 10-iteration dispatch smoke passes in both lanes with 10/100/1,000 prepared registrations. This is correctness smoke, not a replacement for retained performance budgets.
- The [router benchmark](../router/bench/README.md#prepared-router-results) agrees on checksum `3019866368` across C, Rust, Bun, Node, Python, and Bend. The final three-trial native Bend median is 472.5 ms for 160,000 requests; this includes strict target handling and remains a linear scan.

The asterisk/root pairwise regression failed before its fix and passes afterward. A new HEAD lookup check also exposed obsolete second-stage method dispatch; passing the prepared capture map to the business endpoint removes that second selection. Both fixes have retained behavior checks.

Preparation remains O(routes²), and resolution O(routes × segments). New routing/target guarantees have runtime evidence, not new quantified laws. General group construction, typed query access, final authoring signatures, completion notifications, strict JSON, and production transport remain open. Dedicated-process supervision replaces runtime cancellation as the release lifecycle boundary. This does not satisfy the complete SPEC or revalidate earlier framework-overhead budgets.


## Reproduce

```sh
python3 camber/run_ownership.py
python3 camber/run_dispatch.py 1000 3
python3 camber/run_dispatch.py 10000 3
python3 -B camber/run_live.py
```

The first command builds and runs both ownership and reusable-interface checks in native and Bun/JavaScript lanes. The measurement runner starts with 10 iterations, then runs the requested trial size. It warms each workload for 100 iterations, checks the expected result checksum, samples process RSS, kills a process above 20 GiB RSS, and applies command deadlines. The live runner exercises loopback sockets and bundled dependencies. All runners remove their temporary binaries and journals.

The separate [deadlock probe](deadlock_probe.bend) is intentionally unsuccessful. Build and run it in either lane:

```sh
bend camber/deadlock_probe.bend -o /tmp/camber-deadlock
/tmp/camber-deadlock
bend camber/deadlock_probe.bend -o /tmp/camber-deadlock.js
bun /tmp/camber-deadlock.js
```

Both lanes were observed to exit with status 1 after printing that both requests held one instance. The runtime reported `bend: deadlock: every computation waits on a channel`. This is evidence of an unsafe acquisition policy, not a passing server-lifecycle test.

## Ownership and composition

[ownership_check.bend](ownership_check.bend) passed in both lanes:

- The four example routes return the expected status and public JSON.
- Authentication rejects before JSON decoding. Invalid IDs, overflow, malformed JSON, missing or wrongly typed fields, extra fields, repeated keys, and empty names reject without creation.
- Accepted creation writes exactly one actual journal record and returns the expected Location. The user can be read afterward. Internal secret fields are absent from the response.
- A real failed write to a read-only file returns the handle. The failed creation leaves the user absent, and the same handle supports a later lookup.
- Two worker instances are in use while both requests wait at a deterministic barrier. Concurrent Alice and Bob requests return their own principals' users.
- An expected lookup failure overlaps another request. Both instances return to idle. Their files close after all admitted work finishes.

The store is an application fixture: each worker has its own user list and real journal handle. This does not establish shared database consistency or client-pool semantics.

The first runtime check exposed incorrect use of `IO.join` on persistent channels. `IO.join` closes the channel after receiving a value. The retained implementation uses `Chan.recv` for persistent event and release channels, and `IO.join` for one-shot replies.

## Are we fighting Bend?

### What fits

[interface_check.bend](interface_check.bend) passed in both lanes. It demonstrates:

- A reusable, copyable application plan containing route descriptions and runtime configuration, without stored callbacks or handles.
- A closed template executor that receives configuration and affine state as runtime arguments.
- A typed before hook from `Unit` context to `Principal` context. The protected handler receives the established principal, not an unchecked optional identity.
- Rejection without calling the protected handler, and a public health route without authentication.
- Two application configurations that do not leak their response labels into one another.
- A registered alias that invokes the selected action rather than treating the original target as the action.
- A plain `Http.Req -> IO(Http.Res)` echo handler that moves the same packed body into its response, including NUL and non-ASCII octets. Conversion to String occurs only in the test assertion.

These mechanisms respect the language. They do not require copying closures, sharing an affine File, implicit body copies, or a string-key service locator.

### What does not fit

A minimal checker probe declared this field:

```bend
type Route is Data:
  Route{handler: U32 -> U32}
```

Bend 2.0.34 rejected it with `expected: Data; observed: Type`. An ordinary callback is affine even if it captures only copyable data. An Express-style registry of copied callback values cannot be assumed valid. This does not rule out every callback-oriented interface; factories or explicitly threaded affine structures would need their own experiment.

A second probe created a `Chan(U32)` inside `main` and passed a template lambda that captured it. The checker rejected the call with:

```text
a template applied to closed ~ arguments
(queue is a variable here, not comptime: pass it at run time)
```

The same failure was observed at the actual `Http.serve.on` call. Its current handler parameter is a closed template and the serve function has no runtime application-context parameter. The original worker example cannot be adapted through that unchanged entry point. The live probe below passes runtime context explicitly instead.

**Required transport work:** provide an explicit runtime typed-context seam alongside the handler template. Channels may live in copyable context; File handles must remain in their affine owner set. This requirement is additional to the startup, write-outcome, admission, deadlines, and shutdown work already listed in T1-T6.

### Ownership is not liveness

The deadlock probe uses two bounded channels containing real File handles. Request A obtains the first set's instance. Request B obtains the second set's instance. A barrier ensures both hold one instance before either requests the other. Both runtimes report a deadlock.

R2.5's bounded queues do not prevent this failure. The live experiment below uses worker-owned resource bundles created before serving, so no request performs nested dependency checkout. That is a validated candidate, not a frozen public policy. Atomic bundle acquisition or a globally ordered acquisition protocol remain alternatives. A multi-connection pool must also be distinguished from a single checked-out connection; exclusive ownership of a whole pool can serialize otherwise independent work.

## Live transport and bundled dependencies

`python3 -B camber/run_live.py` passed all four scenarios in both native and Bun/JavaScript lanes. [live_check.bend](live_check.bend) uses [http/context_probe.bend](../http/context_probe.bend) as a finite transport probe. The probe reuses HTTP's existing framing state machine, packed receive effects, response writer, keep-alive decisions, and pipelined-rest handling. Its handler template receives copyable runtime context explicitly. It adds no foreign effects and no `@unsafe` definitions.

The live and direct paths call the same `Registry.invoke` executor. Each worker owns a bundle containing a real `Users.Store` journal and a separate real diagnostic File. Both handles are opened before listening and stay together; requests do not acquire resources in opposing orders. GET work can exercise Store first or diagnostic File first without nested checkout. The diagnostic File records POST attempts, including rejected application inputs; it is not a transaction log or a second business-data commit.

| Scenario | Observed result in both lanes |
| --- | --- |
| Four routes and packed-body handler | Correct health, parameter lookup, principal, creation, Location, and read-after-create; unauthorized malformed input rejects; repeated keys reject; NUL/high-octet echo remains exact |
| Keep-alive, pipelining, fragmented sends | Sequential requests reuse a connection; three pipelined responses preserve order; fragmented 1 KiB JSON creates the expected second user |
| Two occupied bundles | Deterministic barriers establish both slots in use; owner reports `busy=2, mask=3`; a third creation receives `503` and reaches neither journal |
| Return and recovery | Opposite operation orders return Alice and Bob correctly; owner reports `busy=0, mask=0`; another request succeeds after exhaustion |
| Store write failure | A read-only Store journal causes `500`, leaves the user absent, preserves both handles, and supports later lookup plus another failed write |
| Diagnostic File write failure | A read-only diagnostic handle causes `500` before application creation; Store stays unchanged; later lookup and another failed attempt work |
| Orderly drain | Listener closes while admitted requests remain held; no bundle closes then; after release, every slot closes once following the final leave event |

The route scenario finishes with 14 completed jobs and no rejection. The exhaustion scenario finishes with four completed jobs and one rejection. Each failure scenario finishes with five completed jobs, no rejection, and no user creation. The runner verifies actual journal contents, public response bytes, and final owner counters. Its separate direct-dispatch journal contains only the expected creation.

One existing transport behavior matters: `Http.serve.keep` closes connections for any `400`, including application input rejection. The live check therefore observes EOF after repeated-key rejection and uses another connection for later work. This is not a new Camber policy. The probe also preserves HTTP's bodyless `204` framing: no Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding is sent.

### Limits of this result

The fixture accepts one to four connections, bounds each connection to 64 framing steps, and has fixed owner/worker fuel. Its message channel has eight slots, and its job queue and admission count are bounded by the one or two bundles. It rejects resource exhaustion instead of building a waiting job queue. The bounds make this validation finite; they are not the release admission, timeout, shutdown, or cancellation design.

The `/_capacity`, `/_release`, `x-hold`, and `x-order` controls are test instrumentation, not Camber API proposals. Ordinary application routing and typed principal work still use the existing experiment. Shared database consistency, crashes, stuck-handler cancellation, startup failure cleanup, client-pool semantics, and full target/method handling remain unproved. Scoped transforms and mapper recovery are checked separately by the direct surface probe below, not by this live fixture. No production HTTP entry point, package version, or human-owned law changed.

The final live runner build observed 17.806 seconds and 5,254.45 MiB sampled compiler-process RSS for native, and 3.743 seconds and 2,920.83 MiB for JS. A preceding native build sampled 5,537.06 MiB. These are compilation observations, not request costs or total process-tree memory. Builds and server processes run sequentially with host deadlines and a 20 GiB RSS ceiling.

The existing affected-package gate, `scripts/check.sh http`, also exited 0. It ran the entry check, existing proof gate, and HTTP checks. Its expected unsafe/foreign dependency report is accepted by the repository's existing verdict wrapper; this is not a claim that host IO has a formal proof. The gate was monitored with a 180-second deadline and a 20 GiB process-group RSS ceiling.


## Direct application-author surface

Run `python3 -B camber/run_surface.py`. All 33 scenarios passed in native and Bend compiled to JS and run on Bun. The latest builds took 8.483 seconds and 2.619 seconds, with sampled compiler-process RSS of 4,270.16 MiB and 2,258.75 MiB respectively. The runner reuses the existing host deadline and 20 GiB RSS guard and runs one build or executable at a time.

`surface_app.bend` is the application example. It declares routes, typed before hooks, response transforms, a decoder, a handler, and an error mapper. It owns a File in its application state. It contains no channels, workers, acquisition messages, or HTTP framing code. `surface.bend` supplies provisional typed lifecycle primitives. This is an interface experiment, not a public API or a published package.

### Affine input and typed hook transitions

The input is genuinely affine:

```bend
type Document is Type:
  Document{principal: Users.Principal, value: Json.Val}
```

Authentication establishes `Users.Principal` before body decoding. The generic endpoint accepts `I: Type` and consumes the decoded input once. The decoder accepts exactly one `doc` envelope field, moves its arbitrary JSON value into `Document`, and rejects malformed JSON, missing/wrong/extra envelope fields, and duplicate envelope fields. Bodies and keys stay packed during decoding. The handler consumes the parsed value into a JSON response after one real receipt write.

Observed responses retained the correct Alice/Bob principal, UTF-8 text, and the exact number text `1e+02`. An escaped spelling of `doc` was accepted after JSON decoding. These are not the SPEC's four-route application or strict JSON prerequisites.

### Entered scopes and single-pass mapping

Semantic stage traces, HTTP policy headers, response bodies, and actual journal bytes establish:

- Before hooks run root, group, route. Two group hooks run in declaration order and pass a typed principal between them.
- Transforms run route, group, root, in reverse declaration order within each scope. The public route's identity entry adapter has no application before hook, but its transform still runs.
- The public sibling gets no user/document policy. An unknown path gets only root policy.
- Authentication rejection precedes parsing. A group early response or expected failure skips the route, decoder, and handler but retains group/root transforms. The early response does not invoke the mapper.
- Decoder rejection has no receipt write. An actual write through a read-only File fails, maps once, and returns a usable handle: the observer reads the original seed through that same handle before closing it.
- Transform failure stops all remaining transforms, including outer scopes. A previously unmapped failure maps once; failure after mapping produces a fixed empty-body `500` without another mapping.
- Mapper failure or invalid mapped status produces that same minimal `500`, without recursion or further transforms. Final invalid status maps once, or falls back without a second mapping if the response was already mapped.
- A successful handler write followed by transform, mapper, or status-validation failure leaves exactly one receipt. Recovery does not replay or undo the handler.

The mapper trace includes the actual error kind, so the checks distinguish decoder, authorization, domain IO, transform, and validation failures. Fault controls and stage traces are fixture instrumentation, not proposed public configuration.

### Ergonomics and limits

Worker plumbing can stay outside application code. The decoder and scoped hook contexts no longer need a blanket `Data` restriction. This surface still requires explicit template types/functions, quantity adapters, scope wrappers, an action enum, and an action-to-route match. The user accepts verbosity for agent consumers; the relevant uncertainty is reliable use, duplication, and ownership mistakes, not line count. These probes establish implementability, not independent-agent usability.

The checker distinguishes `K -> ...` from `@+config: K -> ...` even when `K` is Data. The `.go` adapters keep the callback's affine parameter signature and let its helper reuse copyable configuration or metadata. This avoids rebuilding application records to satisfy the template signature, but adds author-facing boilerplate.

The original dispatcher reused the callback-free list selector and pairwise router. The first 27-scenario revision was direct-only and validated status only. The later socket and response-safety results superseded those limits; the prepared-router cutover above now replaces that selector. RFC 9457 defaults, completion notifications, strict JSON, cancellation, and production lifecycle remain outside the implemented probes.

Simplification ran inline under the no-subagent constraint. It replaced key-to-String conversion with the existing packed `Bytes.eq` and removed an unused runner input fallback. No separate linter is configured for these experiment files. The retained runner compiles and exercises both lanes; existing unaffected HTTP/live/performance gates were not rerun.

Code review: skipped (ce-code-review unavailable) — its independent-agent workflow cannot run under the user's no-subagent constraint. No independent review is claimed.

## Performance evidence

Environment: Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.6.2 arm64, Bend 2.0.34, Bun 1.3.14, Python 3.14.6. The table records medians of three trials of 10,000 iterations on the final measured experiment revision. Units are microseconds per iteration, derived from the runner's millisecond totals.

| Workload | Native | Bun/JS |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Health response | 0.470 | 2.584 |
| Authenticated parameter lookup | 2.692 | 11.249 |
| Invalid-ID rejection | 2.637 | 12.470 |
| 1 KiB JSON construction, parsing, and name validation | 11.445 | 64.727 |
| 1 KiB echo endpoint without route-table selection | 10.764 | 44.668 |
| Same echo endpoint, last hit in 10-entry registry | 14.725 | 53.607 |
| Same echo endpoint, last hit in 100-entry registry | 52.616 | 128.544 |
| Same echo endpoint, last hit in 1,000-entry registry | 466.142 | 939.016 |

All workload checksums agreed with their expected results in both lanes. The 1 KiB JSON payload is `{"name":"Cara"}` followed by spaces to reach 1,024 bytes. Input-body construction occurs inside the timed loop. Store opening, route-table construction, warmup, and final closing are outside the timer. These loops do not perform store writes. Response status and body length are consumed to force results; exact response bytes are checked separately by the correctness runner.

The registry uses the existing pairwise router, tries descriptions in order, and splits patterns repeatedly. The echo endpoint without table selection and the registry variants use the same endpoint, runtime configuration, metadata, and body. Their comparison isolates table selection for this accepted-request workload; it is not an equivalent full-server baseline or Camber's release overhead budget. The registry is an interface probe, not the prepared-router implementation required by R3.

At 1,000 iterations, native medians were 0.485 microseconds for health, 2.709 for parameter lookup, 11.295 for JSON, and 462.624 for the 1,000-entry registry. The 10,000-iteration run is consistent with approximately linear work for these native cases. The shorter run preceded the typed-hook/alias additions; the final large run includes them. JS trial variation and JIT/GC effects remain material.

### Build and memory observations

For the final large run:

| Observation | Native | JavaScript |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Build wall time | 11.522 s | 2.845 s |
| Generated artifact size | 1,867,920 bytes | 244,029 bytes |
| Sampled compiler-process peak RSS | 3,378.20 MiB | 2,443.31 MiB |
| Sampled runtime-process peak RSS | 2.61 MiB | 247.23 MiB |

RSS was sampled with `ps` every approximately 100 ms. These are observed samples, not kernel-recorded peaks or total process-tree memory. Other native builds in this session reached about 3.9 GiB sampled compiler RSS. Keep the repository's one-Bend-process rule even for a small source example that imports HTTP and JSON.

The shorter run sampled 2.59 MiB native runtime RSS and 179.02 MiB JS runtime RSS. The larger JS run used more memory. These observations do not establish bounded retained memory, absence of a leak, admission safety, or overload recovery. They also do not include slow clients, sockets, p99 latency, CPU utilization, or large response bodies.

**Conclusion:** small native application work is promising. The current repeated matcher is unsuitable for a scalable prepared-table design. JS costs and memory need their own budget. No comparative claim about Flask, Fastify, axum, or another production framework is supported here.

## Does the interface make sense?

The behavioral contract makes sense. Explicit input decoding, typed principal establishment, returned responses, and one shared dispatch path are useful, distinct concepts.

The descriptor/template split is one workable interface direction, not the final public interface. Explicit action enums and handler matches can suit agent consumers. Method, path, policy, and dispatch identity must not be repeated in independent selectors; the prepared table should remain canonical. Camber should hide worker/channel protocols but retain visible ownership and types. Compactness or ergonomic parity with callback-based frameworks is not a release goal.

The original ownership fixture's generic decoder restricts input to `Data`. The direct surface probe now accepts a `Type` model containing `Json.Val`, and its generic hook contexts are also `Type`. This removes that assumption from the new candidate without changing the older fixture. It does not freeze the final decoder signature.

Scope inheritance, transform unwind, single-pass mapper recovery, and final response safety have direct and finite-socket evidence. The prepared-router cutover adds strict targets and validated registration. General group construction, typed query access, and completion notifications remain unimplemented by these probes.

## Will agents be able to use it?

The design has useful properties for agents: inspectable static descriptions, explicit resource flow, typed hook transitions, deterministic rejection, compiler feedback, and a port-free execution path. A complete small example gives an agent a pattern to copy rather than an invitation to invent ownership rules.

Most or all consumers are expected to be AI agents. Correctness and performance take priority over concise authoring. Verbose declarations are useful when they carry types, ownership, and explicit transitions. Evaluate success by adding an authenticated route with an affine dependency and expected failure without framework-internal edits, policy leakage, resource loss, or excess overhead. [DESIGN_IDEAS.md](DESIGN_IDEAS.md) records the directions and their tradeoffs; they are not frozen interfaces.

That is a design assessment, not a measured agent-usability result. No subagents or independent application-writing agents were used. These probes were authored and checked in the same session. They do not measure how reliably another agent can add a route, choose quantities, interpret errors, or maintain an application without editing framework internals.

The direct surface example now demonstrates an affine typed route, typed authentication, and expected-error mapping without worker or framing code. Before release, an independent author must exercise the intended public interface rather than these provisional primitives.

## Next work

1. **Integrate the dedicated-process lifecycle.** Preserve cooperative drain and explicit cleanup through shared transport controls. Document an external supervisor that enforces grace and forced termination even if Bend stops making progress, and verify actual process exit. Do not reintroduce embedded isolation or require runtime cancellation.
2. **Prove resource and transport lifecycle recovery.** Preserve resource-bearing replies until explicit cleanup. Exercise startup failure, bounded admission, write outcomes, idle/active connection teardown, and grace completion through shared `http`/`wire` controls. Keep worker-owned bundles distinct from checked-out connections and pools.
3. **Validate agent-oriented authoring.** Preserve explicit types, quantities, and state return. Remove duplicate route decisions and caller-owned lifecycle protocols, not useful annotations. Exercise the actual interface with an independent author when allowed, judging correctness and overhead rather than line count. General group construction and typed query access remain open; no signature is frozen.
4. **Measure complete-application costs and worst-case progress.** Synthetic work and the bounded JSON corpus establish shared event-loop blocking. A default-limit dense JSON array delays ordinary requests about 26–29 ms native and 558 ms JS in the corrected medians. Measure aggregate/burst work, response encoding, and shared body transport; evaluate yielding or offload only against measured costs. Preserve raw controls, failed JS allowances, and external samples. Revalidate the final interface and prepared routing rather than treating historical minimal controls as a complete Camber gate.

The prepared router still needs merge and CI publication. Strict JSON remains an independent release prerequisite. Neither removes the measured progress risk or the missing resource/transport lifecycle controls.

Do not broaden the initial feature set. The next work is making the existing ownership and application contract implementable and usable, not adding plugins, schema generators, or streaming.

## Raw HTTP control and pre-Camber budgets

Run `python3 -B camber/run_raw.py --output camber/raw_results.json`. The retained JSON contains every measured trial, build/artifact observations, verified startup, server/client CPU, latency percentiles, and sampled RSS. `camber/raw_budget.json` freezes numeric per-workload limits and their policy before any new Camber timing. These are raw measurements and chosen engineering limits, not a passed Camber overhead gate.

Environment: Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.6.2 arm64, Bend 2.0.34, Bun 1.3.14, Python 3.14.6.

The same raw handlers serve direct calls and the actual `Http.serve.on.with` entry point. Profile 0 handles text, JSON, parameters, decode, hooks, and byte echo. Separate profiles register exactly 10, 100, or 1,000 canonical `/route/<id>` paths. Generated numeric predicates avoid runtime table construction. This specialized route family is not a general prepared router or a route-count scaling claim; an optimizing compiler can simplify contiguous numeric cases. A JS compiler probe showed that a template Map expression rebuilds its table on each lookup, so it was rejected for this control.

Both lanes use an 8 MiB body limit, the same headers and payload bytes, two keep-alive connections, and no pipelining. Native uses `--threads 1 --gpu off`; Bun uses its event loop. No affinity, exclusive-core allocation, or host-frequency control is applied. The host also runs the Python generator and RSS monitor. Route misses and method failures are successful expected 404/405 responses, not errors. Method failure skips ID response encoding.

Direct trials have ten warmup iterations and 10,000 timed iterations, except 4 MiB echo uses 50. Header construction is outside the timer; fresh request/body construction, handler work, response-length/status consumption, and disposal are inside. The JSON body is `{"name":"Cara"}` plus 1,009 spaces; echo bodies repeat octets `7f 80 00 ff`. Large bodies stay packed. Exact socket checks include both echo sizes, authorization/name rejection, canonical IDs, first/last registered IDs, route boundaries, and method errors.

Live rows have three one-second closed-loop trials and three fixed-rate trials. Each connection warms up before a shared start barrier. Fixed rate is 50% of that row's median closed-loop rate and stays identical across its three trials. Fixed-rate latency starts at scheduled arrival, so client lateness and queued arrivals remain visible; missed schedules are not discarded. Completion timestamps precede body/header comparison, but generator work still affects throughput and later arrivals. Trials drain started requests before stopping. Unexpected responses or transport failures abort rather than producing a successful result.

**Measurement limits:** closed-loop concurrency two measures this generator/server pair; it does not establish server or host saturation capacity. Python scheduling, GIL contention, body validation, and local sockets can limit it. Fixed-rate tails are sometimes tens of milliseconds even when closed-loop response times are submillisecond. Do not interpret those tails as isolated server service time. The CPU observations help expose generator pressure but do not prove the client is non-limiting. One-second trials and low sample counts for 4 MiB echo are exploratory evidence, not sustained-load or precise tail guarantees.

`ps` samples direct-process RSS approximately every 100 ms. Server RSS in trial rows is the cumulative observed peak for that profile, not a fresh per-trial peak, a kernel peak, or process-tree memory. Server CPU is sampled cumulative `ps time` with its platform resolution; phase deltas include connection warmup and monitoring boundaries. Client CPU is the Python process delta, including the monitor thread. Direct-process samples can miss short native runs. Startup timing starts after `Popen` returns and ends at a verified HTTP response, so host process-creation overhead is excluded. Servers are host-terminated after client work drains; graceful shutdown is not claimed.

### Construction, build, startup, and memory

Generating the exact registrations took 0.341 ms and produced 29,940 source bytes. Registrations are compiled ahead of runtime; no runtime table-construction latency is invented.

| Observation | Native | Bun/JS |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Build wall time | 18.861 s | 8.780 s |
| Artifact size | 2,013,480 bytes | 602,645 bytes |
| Sampled compiler-process peak RSS | 6,985.39 MiB | 4,834.86 MiB |
| Profile 0 post-spawn-to-verified-ready | 4.795 ms | 53.235 ms |
| Route-profile post-spawn-to-verified-ready range | 23.271–25.749 ms | 26.676–29.807 ms |
| Largest sampled server-process RSS | 31.56 MiB | 550.22 MiB |

All 18 workloads passed direct checksum and exact live-response checks in both lanes. All 216 recorded live trials had zero unexpected errors. CPU, all latency percentiles, absolute offered rates, and trial sample counts are retained in `raw_results.json`.

### Chosen comparison policy

- Direct added median cost is at most `min(10 us, max(2 us, 0.20 * raw median))`. The floor tolerates small-call overhead; the cap prevents expensive body work from hiding framework cost.
- Closed-loop expected-response throughput is at least 90% of the paired raw median under the same generator and concurrency.
- Both p95 and p99 are at most `raw median percentile + max(0.25 ms, 0.20 * raw median percentile)`, separately for closed-loop and fixed-rate phases.
- Correctness requires zero unexpected status, header, framing, body, or transport errors. Preserve hook counts and rejection behavior, not only payload lengths.
- Future Camber runs must use the recorded absolute fixed rates, identical payload construction, behavior, limits, headers, connection reuse, client concurrency, and scheduler controls. Run three paired raw/Camber trials and compare medians. Historical fixture timings above are not an equivalent Camber candidate. Re-measure raw controls to detect host drift; do not adjust budgets after seeing Camber results.

N means native. Displayed values are rounded; `raw_budget.json` retains the unrounded limits, including both p95 and p99 for both live phases.

The limits are engineering policy, not requirements silently added to the human-owned SPEC. This control records CPU and memory but does not establish production admission, cancellation, retained-memory bounds, overload recovery, cross-language framework comparisons, or release readiness. Earlier unaffected ownership, surface, and finite-live checks were not rerun.

Reuse, quality, and efficiency checks ran inline under the no-subagent constraint. The control reuses HTTP serving/framing, Router extraction, and the existing ID/name/JSON operations. An unused forwarding helper was removed. The published Time import matches HTTP to avoid duplicate foreign clock symbols. No separate linter is configured for these experiment files. The retained runner compiles and exercises both lanes. The independent-review skip above still applies.

## Paired lifecycle controls

The initial `lifecycle_results.json` retains all 18 workloads in both lanes, including all budget failures. There were 432 live trials with zero unexpected response or transport errors. Direct trials alternated raw/scoped order. The first live experiment grouped controls by profile, so paired observations could be separated by about a minute.

The control uses the same numeric registrations, raw business work, payload construction, transport, and exact responses. The scoped side adds one scope, an affine body-owning input adapter, recovery machinery, and real zero/one/five before callbacks. It has no response transforms, File state, or stage trace. Its response validator checks status only. JSON business validation stays in the raw work. This isolates a minimal lifecycle cost; it does not price the full typed application or the later header guard.

Direct medians are microseconds per request. All native added costs passed the frozen allowances.

| echo-4m | 263.680 / 261.460 | 226.403 / 253.633 |

Initial JS direct failures: parameter, hooks-0, hooks-5, hit-1000, miss-1000, method-1000, and echo-4m. Native live throughput failed for json, parameter, hooks-0, hooks-1, hooks-5, method-10, and echo-64k. JS live throughput failed for echo-4m. Of the 72 percentile comparisons per lane, 33 failed in native and 15 in JS. No threshold was relaxed.

Native scoped parameter throughput fell across trials while server CPU also fell, and later workloads recovered. This does not establish a cause. Client lateness explains much of several fixed-rate tails: native raw text p99 was 30.361 ms with scheduling lateness p99 30.186 ms; native scoped JSON-1k was 18.956/18.769 ms; JS scoped JSON-1k was 16.804/16.074 ms. Completion latency still includes lateness. It is not subtracted, and it does not explain every closed-loop failure.

The paired builds took 33.287 seconds native and 12.555 seconds JS, with sampled compiler RSS 7,457,392 KiB and 6,212,448 KiB. Direct warmup is 100 iterations, not the historical raw run's ten. Artifacts and every trial remain described in the JSON.

### Tighter recheck

The current runner pairs each workload/trial closely, alternates AB/BA order, and starts only one server at a time. Absolute offered rates and budgets stay frozen. This recheck targets the original live swings and large-body outlier; it is not a new all-18 pass.

```sh
python3 -B camber/run_lifecycle.py --output camber/lifecycle_recheck.json \
  --workload text --workload parameter --workload hooks-0 \
  --workload hooks-5 --workload echo-4m
```

All 120 live trials passed exact responses without unexpected errors. All five native direct, throughput, and percentile gates passed. All five JS throughput gates passed, but parameter, hooks-0, and hooks-5 failed direct added-cost allowances; hooks-0 also failed closed-loop p99.

| Workload | Native added cost (us) | Native throughput ratio | JS added cost (us) | JS throughput ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| text | 0.583 | 0.987 | 1.729 | 0.969 |
| parameter | 0.689 | 1.024 | 2.034 | 0.983 |
| hooks-0 | 0.669 | 0.969 | 2.294 | 0.937 |
| hooks-5 | 0.840 | 0.972 | 2.822 | 1.157 |
| echo-4m | -7.400 | 1.003 | -4.479 | 0.997 |

Negative added costs are measurement variation, not a claimed lifecycle speedup. The 4 MiB JS direct failure did not reproduce; three small-workload failures did. Better pairing substantially changed the live results, so the first profile-blocked run is not defensible as an isolated framework regression. Both datasets are retained. Host/generator limits, short trials, and low large-body sample counts still apply. These are native Bend versus Bend compiled to JS on Bun, not a comparison with `Bun.serve`.

## Scoped application over sockets and final response safety

Run `python3 -B camber/run_surface_live.py`. Both lanes passed all 33 direct scenario contracts through actual HTTP framing, plus four focused scenarios. Exact statuses, bodies, policy/auth headers, chronological stages, actual journal bytes, returned-handle readback, listener close, and natural process exit are checked.

- A same-worker sequence rejects an unauthenticated malformed request, accepts Alice, serves the public sibling, then accepts Bob. Receipts contain owners 7 and 8 exactly once; policy and principal state do not carry into the next request.
- Alice's successful request is deliberately held after its journal write. Bob's malformed request is submitted through a second connection while that write is observable. Alice returns 201, Bob returns 400, and only Alice has a receipt. The single worker returns its affine state.
- After an actual receipt is observable, the client resets the connection before a held response is released. The handler is not replayed, the receipt remains exactly once, the worker returns its handle, and the process exits naturally. The fixture does not expose the response-write outcome, so no observed write-failure notification or cancellation guarantee is claimed.
- An author-owned plain handler echoes every octet, including NUL and invalid UTF-8, at 64 KiB and 4 MiB. A wrong method returns 405 with `Allow: POST`. No receipt is written.

The initial 64-step finite connection probe could not carry a 4 MiB request plus headers: each read accepts at most 65,536 bytes, so 64 reads exhaust fuel before dispatch. This produced a connection reset. The finite probe now allows 512 framing steps; both binary sizes pass in both lanes. It still has a known finite horizon and is not production admission or cancellation policy.

The socket fixture builds took 14.280 seconds native and 2.824 seconds JS, with sampled compiler RSS 4,752,336 KiB and 2,547,952 KiB. Per-scenario sampled RSS and wall times are retained in `surface_live_results.json`; very short runs can evade RSS sampling.

### Confirmed guard defect and regression

The old application validator accepted an unsafe framing header. `response_check.bend` failed before the fix with `unsafe header accepted`. The shared application callback now uses `response.bend` to check status 200–599, nonempty lowercase token names, safe octet values, and framing/connection ownership before handing a response to transport.

It rejects CRLF injection, NUL/other controls, DEL, non-octet code points, uppercase/non-token names, and `content-length`, `transfer-encoding`, `keep-alive`, `upgrade`, `te`, `trailer`, and `proxy-connection`. `connection` values must be exactly `close`. HTAB, token punctuation, obs-text, repeated ordered cookies, and the original packed body are preserved. The checker passed natively and on Bun.

Six added application scenarios inject unsafe values, framing, or names in a root transform, before or after an earlier error mapping. Direct and socket checks confirm one mapper at most, a safe 500 result, no unsafe wire headers, and no replay of a completed journal write. Header checking walks the existing Map tree without building an intermediate field list.

### Authoring assessment

`author_app.bend` adds a plain `Http.Req -> IO(Http.Res)` handler inside existing root/public policies without changing `surface.bend`. This is a same-author exercise, not independent usability evidence. Its small handler still needs explicit template arguments, quantity adapters, scope wrappers, metadata reconstruction, and an application dispatch adapter. The hardcoded route branch is not prepared registration. Reusing the lifecycle works; the intended small public authoring surface is not yet demonstrated.

## Executed prerequisite and cancellation limitations

`prerequisites.bend` prints observations rather than pinning defects as desired behavior. Build it in either lane and pass an owned temporary journal path. `prerequisite_results.json` retains the historical pre-cutover outputs below; [router_prerequisite_results.json](router_prerequisite_results.json) records the corrected routing outputs in both lanes, with JSON rejection still false and a side effect still occurring after the deadline returns.

| Proposed contract | Native and Bend-on-Bun observation |
| --- | --- |
| Preserve double/trailing slash distinctions | `/users//7` and `/users/7/` match collapsed paths |
| Static precedence independent of registration order | Parameter-first registry selects the parameter; static-first selects the static route |
| Reject an unpaired surrogate during parsing | A lone high-surrogate escape is accepted |
| Reject duplicate keys in nested objects | `{"outer":{"id":1,"id":2}}` is accepted |
| Default depth 64 enforced during parsing | A depth-65 array is accepted |
| Deadline cancels pending work | Deadline returns, then the delayed action writes `late` and closes its File |

With a nominal 10 ms timeout, the deadline observation was at 13.850 ms native and 21.913 ms JS; the actual late side effect was at 256.286 ms and 256.930 ms. The journal contains `late` followed by LF after process exit. Timing is measured, not an exact-deadline guarantee. This is the documented behavior of `Conc.timeout`, not a compiler bug or genuine cancellation.

Prepared routing belongs in `router` and now has the implementation and runtime evidence above. Strict surrogate, nested-duplicate, and configurable depth rejection belong in `json` and remain release blockers. Real cancellation still needs runtime support, but the user-approved dedicated-process contract no longer requires it. The historical observations do not claim the full revised SPEC is satisfied.

The final inline reuse/quality/efficiency pass removed unused imports, reused existing socket/effect/scope helpers, and kept body ownership unchanged. The affected direct and socket surfaces and response checker were exercised in both lanes. Unaffected ownership and older finite-live suites were not rerun. No independent review, publication, production deployment, or PR watcher was performed.

The affected HTTP gate was run sequentially with the RSS/deadline guard: `http/http.bend --check-only`, `http/PROOF.bend --check-only`, then `http/check.bend`. Entry/proof checks produced the existing accepted foreign/unsafe dependency report, with no `LAWS` failure; the HTTP runtime checks exited 0. This is the same verdict policy as `scripts/check.sh http`, not a proof of foreign IO.

## Independent LLM authoring and proof study

[The completed comparison](author_study/RESULTS.md) retains initial submissions, bounded same-author repairs, visible transcripts, model receipts, and runtime/proof/mutation evidence. Grok 4.7 ran through `xai-oauth/grok-4.7`; Opus 5.5 ran through `cursor/claude-opus-5-5`.

Neither initial submission passed every gate. Grok initially passed 29 direct and 30 socket scenarios but failed the proof dependency gate and exact affine dispatch signature; it needed two repairs. Opus initially passed the four ordinary proofs but failed application compilation on computed-local matching; it needed one repair. Both final candidates pass four ordinary laws, the typed native consumer, 29 direct cases, 30 socket scenarios, and both proof/runtime mutation checks.

This is not a clean blinded comparison: Grok read the parent runtime oracle, Opus consulted unrelated proof examples, and both exceeded the cooperative read boundary. Final semantic success does not erase those protocol deviations. Independent Lean-kernel attestation is unavailable. The study supports documenting proof-safe Bytes dependencies, affine callback adapters, and parameter-matching decoder patterns; it does not establish a model ranking, full SPEC conformance, IO proofs, or production readiness. No submitted implementation was repaired by the host.

## Current validation status

Production implementation is on hold while the remaining release risks are validated. The authoring study passed its final semantic checks, not the complete production release contract. Retained strict-JSON failures, missing production transport controls, and unfavorable performance observations remain open; they are not being rerun merely to confirm them.

| Release checkpoint | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership and composition | Compiled resource-bundle pool, concurrent request checks, real failure/return/close observations | Mechanism demonstrated; final public library and recorded SPEC mechanism still pending |
| Shared prerequisites before route slice | Prepared router is implemented but PR 315 remains open; strict surrogate, nested duplicate, and parse-time depth failures are retained | Blocked; no manual publication |
| Complete production application slice | Experimental typed/scoped direct and socket paths work; independent author submissions converge after repairs | Not a finished public package; general groups, typed query access, defaults, and notifications remain open |
| Production transport and lifecycle | Startup/admission/write-outcome gaps are observed; separate external-kill fallback is demonstrated | Integrated bounded transport and cooperative shutdown remain open |
| Full-application performance | Raw/paired and external comparisons are retained; JS budget failures and large-body latency gaps remain | Not passed; no budget relaxation |

The aggregate experiment uses held batches of 4, 16, and 126 dense 1 MiB JSON bodies, with a small-input smoke and a yielding control. The largest batch has 126 workload connections plus an ordinary connection and a timed-read connection: 128 sockets. Native single/default CPU-thread configurations and JS are measured separately. A 180-second host observation window permits the larger batch to finish; it is not an application deadline or a relaxed performance budget. The existing 20 GiB process-RSS kill guard remains in force.

The aggregate experiment is complete: [39 retained observations](json_aggregate_results.json) cover native single/default CPU-thread configurations and JS. Every case returns all exact workload responses, the exact ordinary and recovery responses, a real ETIMEDOUT and peer EOF, and natural process exit. Functional success does not establish acceptable progress: ordinary work and timeout delivery wait behind the dense batch.

At 126 dense 1 MiB workloads, median ordinary latency is 16.061 seconds native single-thread, 16.179 seconds native default threads, and 43.092 seconds JS. The configured 200 ms timed read closes after 16.113, 16.231, and 43.149 seconds respectively. No ordinary handler runs before the last workload completes in those nine trials. All three lanes recover with a median subsequent request below 1 ms.

### Aggregate JSON work: results and limits

Run `python3 -B camber/run_json_aggregate.py`. Preserve the existing dataset before another run; the runner refuses to overwrite it. Three trials per dense batch and yielding control, plus one small-input smoke, run in each lane. The same existing dense-array fixture is used; there is no hand-written parser or production change.

| Lane | Held 1 MiB workloads | Median ordinary latency (ms) | 200 ms read: median arm to close (ms) | Maximum sampled process RSS (MiB) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native, one CPU thread | 4 | 108.836 | 203.667 | 35.8 |
| Native, one CPU thread | 16 | 1,583.813 | 1,639.081 | 47.9 |
| Native, one CPU thread | 126 | 16,060.868 | 16,112.921 | 158.4 |
| Native, default CPU threads | 4 | 111.519 | 204.664 | 35.8 |
| Native, default CPU threads | 16 | 1,572.515 | 1,626.971 | 47.8 |
| Native, default CPU threads | 126 | 16,179.388 | 16,231.407 | 158.3 |
| JS on Bun | 4 | 1,533.611 | 1,585.066 | 554.7 |
| JS on Bun | 16 | 6,137.436 | 6,193.413 | 1,074.4 |
| JS on Bun | 126 | 43,091.533 | 43,148.882 | 2,661.4 |

The 126-workload yielding control has median ordinary latency 2.268 ms native single-thread, 2.283 ms native default threads, and 6.513 ms JS. Its timed reads close after 203.739, 203.147, and 204.502 ms. Many waiting computations alone do not explain the dense-batch delay. More native CPU threads do not resolve this serial parser/event-loop case.

All bodies are framed and held in distinct one-shot channels before release. They are loaded sequentially, then released together; the ordinary request is sent 1 ms after the host sees the first CPU_BEGIN marker. Per-workload internal monotonic durations and their sums agree closely with observed batch completion, so the large stalls are not inferred from buffered start/end logs alone. The timer is a separate real Wire read, not an implemented absolute HTTP header/body/write deadline.

The largest batch holds 126 MiB of input. Sampled JS process RSS reaches about 2.6 GiB; this is not a memory upper bound. Each case uses a fresh process, so these measurements do not establish steady-state reuse, absence of leaks, sustained-overload memory bounds, or memory recovery. The recovery measurement proves subsequent response progress, not RAM reclamation. No runtime reaches the 20 GiB kill guard.

**Readiness consequence:** per-request body/depth limits and finite admitted counts do not establish aggregate CPU responsiveness. The proposed large-body/concurrency combination still needs a measured aggregate-work policy or a justified yielding/isolation design before production confidence. This fixture does not configure production admission, change the release budgets, prove scheduler isolation, or repair the shared transport. Strict JSON and integrated production transport/lifecycle blockers remain open.

### JSON slowdown attribution (2026-10-03)

The deeper investigation separates three causes: Bend's cooperative event-loop scheduling, a native automatic-erasure performance problem, and the allocation-heavy JSON value representation. HTTP and Camber are not necessary to reproduce the native degradation. [Raw observations and source snapshots](json_attribution_results.json), [native sample](json_attribution_native_profile.txt), and [JS CPU profile](json_attribution_js_profile.json) are retained. The original aggregate dataset is unchanged.

**Native runtime:** a Base-only reproduction builds, channel-retains, receives, and automatically drops 524,283 wrapped one-word arrays, 24 times. There are no kit imports, sockets, parallel calls, unsafe defs, retained input, or list reversal. On Bend 2.0.35, build times start at 6/4/14 ms and later include 152/178/265/312 ms; disposal starts at 10 ms and later includes 296/515 ms. Explicitly matching each list item and its wrappers before dropping its buffer keeps build at 3–5 ms and disposal at 3–4 ms, with one 7 ms disposal observation. This isolates automatic reclamation and its effect on subsequent allocation, rather than parser logic or concurrency, as a cause of progressive native cost.

The slower behavior also occurs on 2.0.34. Before reporting it, the compiler was updated from 2.0.34 to 2.0.35, the guide was reread, and the Base-only reproduction was run on the current release. Searches for allocation performance, term_drop, freelist slowdown, and drop performance found no matching issue. Upstream report: [bendlang/bend#1307](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/issues/1307). The installed compiler is now 2.0.35; historical measurements remain labeled with their original compiler.

**Fixed upstream (2026-10-24):** Bend 2.0.38 includes the fix, [bendlang/bend#1438](https://github.com/bendlang/bend/pull/1438), which frees a recursive spine cell by cell. CI pins 2.0.38. On 2.0.38 (macOS arm64), three runs of the minimal reproduction stay flat across all 24 repeats: build is 3–6 ms and disposal is 6–9 ms. Each run takes about 0.25 s and has a peak RSS of 30 MiB. The 126-body JSON batch with automatic disposal was not run again on 2.0.38.

Run the minimal reproduction without the kit or network:

```sh
bend camber/allocation_minimal.bend -o /tmp/camber-allocation-minimal
/tmp/camber-allocation-minimal +RTS --threads 1 --gpu off -RTS
```

The native isolated JSON sample places 1,880 of 4,247 main-thread samples (44%) in `term_drop`; an IO helper thread waits throughout. That fraction applies to the isolated, stage-instrumented probe, not the original server. Generated C uses size-class free lists, and automatic erasure frees descendants before their containers. Allocation/reclamation order and cache locality are a plausible explanation for the progressive cost, not a proven cache-level diagnosis. Removing reversal alone does not eliminate the Base-only slowdown. A plain list of arrays without nested wrappers stays fast; holding 126 MiB of Base arrays is not necessary for the degradation.

**Our JSON representation:** `Json.Num` stores each number's exact text in its own `Bytes.Bytes`, arrays use linked `List<Val>`, and finished arrays reverse the list. The dense 1 MiB document has 524,283 numbers. This creates hundreds of thousands of tiny buffers and nested wrappers. It is a semantic design choice, not evidence of quadratic parsing, but it heavily exercises the affected native runtime and adds allocation/work in JS.

**Live causal intervention:** experimental `json-dispose` mode parses the same dense fixture with the same existing parser, then structurally consumes its numeric values. It is fixture-only and checks the expected item count; it is not a general JSON decoder or a production workaround. On the original live socket scenario, all ten new observations pass exact workload, ordinary, recovery, ETIMEDOUT, peer EOF, marker-count, and natural-exit checks. Six initial explicit-disposal trials have median ordinary latency 525 ms at 16 bodies and 3.702 seconds at 126 bodies. To control for the compiler update, three fresh automatic-disposal runs use the same 2.0.35 binary at 126 bodies: ordinary latency is 46.6/76.4/78.9 seconds. A subsequent explicit-disposal run is 4.652 seconds. The automatic timings vary strongly; do not advertise a stable speedup or infer a compiler-release regression from the nonmatched historical 2.0.34 data.

Even the faster intervention still delays an ordinary request and the real socket timeout for seconds. It removes a major source of native cost, not the cooperative scheduling boundary. More worker threads do not preempt serial pure work; the guide explicitly says each computation runs pure code until its next effect. This is runtime semantics, not a demonstrated scheduler defect.

**JavaScript:** isolated 2.0.34 dense-array parse-to-retained-result averages about 613 ms per body at count 16, compared with 18 ms for the equally sized string document. The measured disposal interval is below 1 ms, but deferred GC may run elsewhere. A 2.0.35 whole-process CPU profile identifies `List.reverse`, `Bytes.peek`, number finalization, and `array_new` as hotspots. It includes untimed setup and profiling overhead, so it is not a parse-only percentage breakdown. No native-erasure diagnosis is claimed for JS, and `JSON.parse` is not substituted because its number, duplicate-key, and string behavior differ.

**Resolution:** no production library behavior was changed, no unsafe disposal API was added, and no special-case input path was shipped as a fix. The fixture intervention establishes causality and remains an experimental control. A general native remedy belongs in Bend's erasure/allocator implementation; changing the kit's JSON representation or adding a native decoding effect requires a separate measured design that preserves exact-number and parsing contracts. Neither alone guarantees server responsiveness. Aggregate CPU admission or yielding/isolation still needs to be designed and measured before production confidence. Strict JSON and integrated transport/lifecycle gates remain open. Additional independent review did not run.

The retained attribution dataset contains 35 runtime observations, including ten exact live socket checks. All three retained executable probes compile natively on 2.0.35. `--check-only` on the stage-timing probe reports 18 definitions relying on unsafe or foreign code, including imported clock effects and their IO dependents; no formal proof of host timing or IO is claimed. One-off comparison scaffolds were removed after saving their exact source in the dataset. Reuse, quality, and efficiency were inspected inline; the standing independent-review skip remains unchanged.
