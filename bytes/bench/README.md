# Bytes benchmark

This runs byte-buffer operations in two Bend layouts and five other languages.

- `packed.bend` measures the packed `Array<U32>` layout used by this package: four bytes per slot, little-endian.
- `string.bend` measures the former layout: a `String`, one `Char` list cell per byte.

## Run

```sh
python3 run.py      # 3 runs per variant, median; Python and Bend String run once
python3 run.py 5    # 5 runs
```

You need `bend`, `clang`, `rustc`, `go`, `bun`, `node`, and `python3`. Binaries go to `out/`, which git ignores. The run takes about a minute. It exits non-zero if any build fails, or if the variants that run at 256 MiB disagree on a checksum.

## The ops

Every program times each op in-process and prints its checksum. Except for `build`, the buffer is N = 2^28 bytes (256 MiB). `bench.*` takes log2(N) as its first argument. The Bend files have N built in: 2^28 in `packed.bend`, and 2^26 in `string.bend`, since 256 MiB as a list takes more than 4 GiB. `run.py` multiplies the `String` times by 4. Checksum math is u32 and wraps.

| op | work | checksum |
|---|---|---|
| `fill` | allocate N bytes, set `b[i] = (31i + 7) & 255`, then set the last 4 bytes to `13,10,13,10` | `b[12345] + b[N-1]` |
| `sum` | add up every byte | the sum |
| `find` | index of the first `\r\n\r\n` (it is at N-4) | the index |
| `slice` | copy `b[N/4+1 .. N/4+1+N/2)` into a new buffer (not word-aligned) | first + last byte |
| `concat` | append N/65536 new 64 KiB chunks (chunk k is filled with `k & 255`) to an empty buffer that is not preallocated | first + last byte |
| `random` | 2^24 reads: `x = x*1664525 + 1013904223`, `idx = x >> (32 - log2 N)` | the sum |
| `equal` | compare `b` with a copy of it (the copy is made before the timer starts) | 1 |
| `build_1000000`, `build_4000000` | start empty; append bytes `i & 255` one at a time, without reserving capacity | size + last byte |

The two `build` sizes use 1,000,000 and 4,000,000 bytes, not the 256 MiB used by the other ops. Bend Array calls `Bytes.append` with a one-byte buffer each time. Bend String has no build row: `string.bend` measures construction in `fill`, not incremental append.

Each language uses its idiomatic stdlib calls: `memmem`/`memcmp` in C, `windows(4).position` in Rust, `bytes.Index`/`bytes.Equal` in Go, `Buffer.indexOf`/`Buffer.equals` in JS, and `bytes.find` in Python. There is no hand-written SIMD and no third-party code.

The reported `sum` uses the `sum_bytewise` output from `packed.bend`. It reads one byte at a time, as a `Bytes.get` caller would. The table omits the word-at-a-time `sum` output and `find_swar`, which skips words that hold no `\r`. Neither was faster in the recorded run.

## Results

M4 Pro, macOS, 2026-09-27, from `python3 run.py`. Median of three runs, except Python and Bend String (one run). Every variant that runs at 256 MiB printed the same checksums. Times are in ms; `Nx` is the multiple of the fastest variant for that op.

`String` has no `random` row, because every read walks the list and is O(n). It has no `build` rows either (see above). Its geomean covers the other six ops.

Four times as many one-byte appends took Bend Array 4.2 times as long. This is consistent with linear growth; the two sizes do not prove an asymptotic bound.

## Reading it

- A packed `Array` is about 6 to 260 times faster than `String`, and it uses 1/16 of the memory.
- Over the seven buffer ops, without the `build` rows, the geomean is 4.0x for Bend Array, 4.1x for Node, and 3.2x for Go. Random reads match C. The one-byte `build` appends are 32 to 36 times slower than C, which pulls the full geomean to 6.4x.
- `find` is the weak spot. Go and JS hand it to SIMD `memchr`/`memmem`, and a Bend loop cannot call host code outside `IO`. Closing that gap probably needs native `Array` primitives in Bend itself. The C and Python columns are slow here for a different reason: macOS `memmem` and CPython's search do not use SIMD for this pattern.
- `concat` keeps the chunks in a list and copies them once at the end. `Array.join` might make that O(1) per chunk; it has not been tried.

## Later: parallel ops

For now we accept the gap: `find` is about 20x slower, and `concat` about 4x. Every Bend op here is one sequential loop.

The idea to try later: other standard libraries close gaps like these with SIMD, and Bend can close them with fork-join instead. `Array` is a binary tree (`ALeaf{value}` / `ANode{xs, ys}`), so an op can match `ANode{xs, ys}` and run `a b = op(xs) op(ys)` on all cores. Compare against each language's standard library as it is. If Bend's parallelism beats their SIMD, that counts.

Plan:

1. Run every op at several sizes, say 256 B, 4 KiB, 64 KiB, 1 MiB, and 256 MiB. HTTP headers are small, and on small buffers forking costs more than it saves.
2. Go parallel automatically once a buffer passes a size cutoff. Take the cutoff from those size curves, and stay sequential below it.
3. Parallelize `fill`, `sum`, `find`, and `equal`. `find` has to catch a match that spans the split: each half reports its first and last 3 bytes, or the halves overlap by 3 bytes. Try `Array.join` for `concat`.

Keep in mind that parallelism borrows idle cores, while SIMD speeds up one core. On a loaded server every core is already busy, so the cutoff should be conservative.

## Caveats

- Bend times itself with `Time.mono`, a nanosecond clock.
- Bend `concat` and `find_swar` vary up to 2x between runs. Rerun before you trust a small change.
- The byte-at-a-time `sum` beats the word-at-a-time one, even on `--threads 1`. The likely cause is clang optimizing the C that Bend emits for the byte loop better. That is not confirmed.
- These are micro-benchmarks on one machine. They measure primitives, not an HTTP parser.
