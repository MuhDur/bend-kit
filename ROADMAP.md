# bend-kit roadmap

The goal is a general-purpose library for Bend 2: the packages a program needs that Base does not have, each proved against its laws. This is a ranked backlog, not a promise. The top of **Next** is what we work on now. Each checkbox is one outcome. Re-rank items when evidence changes.

New packages are tracked as GitHub issues with a `pri-high`, `pri-med`, or `pri-low` label: high is what most programs need first, low is what can wait. `gh issue list --label pri-high` lists one priority. Each new package gets its own folder; see the layout in [README.md](README.md).

## Current baseline

- Published packages use `bend-kit-<package>` on the Bend hub; [README.md](README.md) lists their imports. Each hub description links to its source folder. `http` and `dns` pin shared dependencies by hash or version, so callers can share their types.
- Run `scripts/check.sh` to check package laws and examples.
- Big bodies need a native build (`bend file.bend -o app`). The `bend file.bend` runner overflows on strings over about 30 KB.

### bytes

- `bytes` is a byte buffer packed four bytes to a `U32` `Array` slot. It has bounds-checked `get`/`set`, `slice`, `append`, `concat`, `find`, and `eq`, and it converts to and from byte strings. `bytes/bench` measures the layout.
- `bytes` also reads and writes u16, u32, and u64 in both byte orders (`get.u32be`, `set.u16le`, `get.u64be`, ...), searches with `find.from`, `rfind`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `split`, orders buffers with `cmp`, and converts to and from hex and padded base64. The u64 forms use `int`'s `Int.U64`, which is slow until Base has a native `U64`. `append` writes into the left buffer while it has room and at least doubles it when it does not, so building 200 K bytes one at a time takes 0.6 s instead of 215 s.

### wire

- `wire` holds the effects Base lacks: byte-exact TCP/UDP, a TCP connect with a deadline, and TLS through OpenSSL 3 loaded at run time (`BEND_LIBSSL` overrides the path). Each effect has a C and a JS version. The `.words` forms move bytes in the `bytes` layout, with no list cell per byte (`52ca321`).

### unicode

- `unicode` has Unicode 17.0.0 general category, canonical combining class, NFC and NFD, full case folding, and extended grapheme clusters, in pure Bend. `gen.py` generates the tables from the UCD. `conformance.py` passes every line of `NormalizationTest.txt` (NFC and NFD) and `GraphemeBreakTest.txt`.

### regex

- `regex` compiles RE2 syntax to a Pike VM with capture groups and matches in linear time: `(a*)*b` against 200 000 a's takes 267 ms. Its fixtures agree with Go's `regexp`.

### http

- `Http.fetch(method, url, headers, body)` does http and https, DNS, redirects (20 hops), and a 30 s timeout per step. It runs on a pool of its own that it closes; `Http.pool.*` keeps up to 8 idle sockets per origin across calls (`pool.new.with(cap)`) and retries an idempotent request once when a reused socket fails before any response byte (`b566beb`). `fetch.with(..., ms)` sets the timeout. It returns `Result<Res, Err>`: bad URL, DNS, connect, TLS (errno and verify text), read, write, timeout, too many redirects, or a malformed response. `ETIMEDOUT` is 60 on macOS and 110 on Linux. Headers are a list per name. `header` is the first value. `Set-Cookie` is never joined. Encode writes one line per value.
- Bodies are `Http.Body` (`Bytes.Bytes` from `bend-kit-bytes`, with `Http.from_string`, `to_string`, and `length`): `Req.body`, `Res.body`, request bodies, stream pieces, and the wire bytes of `encode`, `encode_req`, and `exchange`. The `String` parsers (`parse`, `frame`) stay as the spec. `Http.text` decodes UTF-8. `Http.json` parses the body with `Json.parse.bytes`. `Url.form` writes a form body. `fetch` and `open` advertise gzip and deflate, plus br and zstd when their libraries load. They decode known Content-Encoding values in reverse order; an unknown coding stays as sent. `Http.open.raw` returns encoded stream pieces, and `Http.upload` streams request bodies.
- A bad chunk or bad framing is `FrameBad` while the connection is still open. A close-delimited TLS body that ends without `close_notify` is a read error. Content-Length and chunked bodies do not wait for that close. `100` and `103` are skipped; `101` is final.
- `fetch`, `exchange`, and streams read into `Bytes` and frame each read once: the head is parsed when it is whole, and chunk data runs are sliced whole. A Content-Length body of up to 16 MiB is allocated once from its length, and each read is written into it (#52). At 12 MiB a download takes about 8 ms in-process and peaks at 19 MB of RSS, down from 32 MB: the body sits in a 16 MiB array (arrays are a power of two in size). Chunked and close-delimited bodies still join their pieces at the end, and peak at about 33 MB. Streaming the same body with `Http.open` peaks at 2.4 MB. It took 1.1 s and 1.1 GB with Content-Length, and 27.5 s chunked, which re-framed the whole buffer after every read (`http/bench/fetch16.bend`). A `String` body alone held 434 MB. The cap is 16 MiB of body and 64 KiB of head; before, a body of exactly 16 MiB failed.
- `Dns.resolve.all` returns the OS-ordered IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, and HTTP tries each one until TCP connects within the step timeout. A bracketed IPv6 URL keeps brackets in its `Host` field. `Dns.resolve.pure` checks `/etc/hosts`, then the first three nameservers; `resolve.at` asks one server. A silent server is 2 attempts × 5 s, then the next server. `Http.exchange` does one request on an open socket and says whether that socket can take another.
- `Http.serve` reads into `Bytes`, parses the head once, and joins the body once; chunk data runs are sliced whole. A 16 MiB upload takes about 0.03 s, down from 2.7 s on a `String` buffer and 0.26 s with a `String` body (`f3ceb23`, `http/bench/serve16.bend`). A 12 MiB response goes out in about 25 ms. It sends 100 Continue when a request expects it. It keeps HTTP/1.1 connections open and answers pipelined requests in order (`a7d28f7`). `serve.with` sets the request cap; the default is 16 MiB. A bad request is 400, an oversized one 413, a head over 64 KiB 431. It sends the RFC 9110 reason phrase, no body for HEAD, 1xx, 204 and 304, and accepts `HTTP/1.0` without `Host`.
- `Http.serve.stream` accepts bounded request pieces, and `Http.serve.write` sends bounded response pieces (`6c37df7`, `49fefbf`). Rejected requests drain unread bytes within a byte and time bound before close ([#268](https://github.com/paymog/bend-kit/issues/268)).
- Header lines, request targets, and URLs parse in linear time. They were O(n²), so a 70 KB header or a 32 KB `Location` held a worker for 20 to 30 s (`05cbd5b`, `7487a84`). The `url` package has no `@unsafe` defs.
- The README fetch example builds natively with its published HTTP import.

## Next

- [ ] **Prove universal laws.** Most laws are fixtures. Add laws over all inputs for the claims that matter most: `res.frame` agrees with `frame` for every split of the bytes, `dc.feed` of `a ++ b` equals feeding `a` then `b`, `parse.got` never says Bad to a prefix of a valid request, `utf8.decode(utf8.encode(s)) == s`, `Json.parse.bytes(Json.encode.bytes(v)) == Some{v}`, and `Bytes.to_string(Bytes.from_string(s)) == s` for every byte string.
- [ ] **Report the runner overflow upstream.** `String.repeat`/`String.length` on about 30 KB overflows in the `bend file.bend` runner but not in native builds. Report it to Bend with the three-line repro.

### Tier 1

- [x] Bytes: endian ints, builder, search, compare (#20)
- [x] Integer types: U8, U16, U64, I32, I64 (#21)
- [x] Filesystem and paths (#22)
- [x] Process and OS (#23)
- [x] Generic collections (#24). A hash map can now build on `hash` (#27).
- [x] Text formatting and number parsing (#25)
- [x] Time: clock, Duration, Instant, dates, time zones (#26). POSIX TZif footer rules cover instants after the last explicit transition (#198).

### Tier 2

- [x] Non-cryptographic hashing (#27): FNV-1a, xxHash, SipHash-1-3, CRC-32, and Adler-32 over `Bytes`. `zlib` still has its own CRC-32 and Adler-32.
- [x] Cryptography: SHA-2, SHA-1, HMAC, HKDF, secure random (#28)
- [x] Random numbers: seeded PRNGs and distributions (#29). `F64` distributions such as normal are not wired to `f64` yet.
- [x] Property-based testing (#30): seeded generators, shrinking, and a runner that prints the seed and smallest reachable failure.
- [x] Regex (linear time, RE2-style) (#32)
- [x] Serialization (#33): `csv` (RFC 4180) and `cbor` (RFC 8949) over `Bytes`. Use [eztoml](https://github.com/Emerging-Patterns/eztoml) for TOML 1.0. MessagePack and YAML wait for a caller.
- [x] CLI argument parsing (#34): use [shake](https://github.com/Emerging-Patterns/shake) from the hub
- [x] Logging (#35): `notch`
- [ ] Big numbers: BigInt, BigDecimal, rationals (#36)
- [x] F64: 64-bit floating point (#37). Soft-float on two `U32` halves until Base has `F64`.
- [x] Packed F32 arrays (#610): `f32array`, with element-wise ops, `dot`, `sum`, `max`, and `Bytes` and file loading in either byte order.
- [x] Protocol Buffers (#310): pure proto3 wire codec and typed Bend code generation through `protoc`.

### Tier 3

- [x] Parser combinators (#38)
- [x] Compression through libz, libzstd, and libbrotlidec, and `http` decoding with them (#142)
- [x] Concurrency helpers: `par_map`, `par_reduce`, a worker pool, `select`, and `timeout` (#40)
- [x] Databases: SQLite binding and Postgres client (#41)
- [x] Redis and Valkey client: `redis`, RESP3 over `wire` (#205). Pub/sub, cluster, sentinel, and client-side caching come later.
- [x] LLM API client: `llm`, Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Chat Completions on `hairpin`, with an SSE parser (#250). Typed tool use, images, and pooled streams come later.
- [x] Networking: RFC 6455 WebSocket client, RFC 6265bis cookie jar, and RFC 7578 multipart form-data (#42).
- [ ] Templating and Markdown (#43)
- [ ] Math and statistics (#44)
- [ ] Diff and text utilities (#46)

### Existing packages

- [ ] **Decode bodies without a `String` copy.** `decoded` turns a compressed body into a `String` for `zlib` and the result back into `Bytes`. The native effects in #142 take and return the `Bytes` layout, which removes both copies.
- [ ] **Speed up JSON.** On the 1.36 MB bench document, `Json.parse.bytes` takes 3 ms and `Json.encode.bytes` 4 ms; Bun takes about 2 ms and 1 ms. The encoder still takes one step per byte.

## Later

- [ ] **JSON number to F32.** `Json.at` and `Json.u32` exist.
- [ ] Windows support (the effects use POSIX sockets and `dlopen`).
- [ ] Test on an x86_64 Mac.

## Depends on the Bend hub

- The hub registers at most five new names per account per day.
- Packages ship `.c` and `.js` effects that run host code, and proofs do not cover them. The hub does not show this before import.
