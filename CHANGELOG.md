# Changelog

Older changes are in the git history. Each package's version is `<pkg>/VERSION`. On merge to `main`, CI publishes `bend-kit-<package>@<VERSION>` unless that version is already on the hub.

The kit is in alpha. A breaking change bumps the second number (`0.3.0.0` to `0.4.0.0`). Do not keep a compatibility shim.

When you change `<pkg>.bend` or `effs/`, raise `VERSION` and add a line here for that package.

## Unreleased

- `cache` 0.1.0.0: cache validity for keyed values. Fetches take per-key generations; a completion lands only at or above the key's floor, then raises it. Invalidation voids fetches in flight, eviction keeps generations, and entries expire by TTL or negative TTL from the fetch start. Proved over any sequence of operations on a key: no expired read, stale completions stay stale, an older fetch cannot overwrite a newer one, and eviction changes only the current entry.
- `authz` 0.1.0.0: new package. Pure authorization policies with deny-overrides, default deny, intersection, and fail-closed missing context, with proved composition laws. `check.bend` guards a Camber route with it.
- `journal` 0.1.0.0: an append-only journal. Each record is one frame with a checked length and a CRC-32. Appends are fsync'd before they answer. `open` cuts a torn tail and refuses a corrupt frame. Proved on a list model: round trip, exact committed prefix after a torn append, corruption that a later tail cannot hide, order kept with nothing invented, and replay equal to a fold over the recovered records.
- `jwt`, `webhooks`, `oauth2`, and `sigv4` 0.3.0.1: import `crypto` 0.2.2.1, so native builds on Bend 2.0.36 compile.
- `llm`, `webhooks`, `sigv4`, `jwt`, and `oauth2` 0.3.0.0: import `hairpin` 0.3.0.0, `bend-kit-http@0.32.0.0`, and `time` 0.1.2.1, so they check on Bend 2.0.36. Breaking: `Http` and `Time` types come from those versions. The local test servers in `check.bend` use the current `Http.conn`.
- `hairpin` 0.3.0.0: imports `bend-kit-http@0.32.0.0` instead of `0.23.0.1`, and `time` 0.1.2.1, so it checks on Bend 2.0.36. Breaking: `Http` and `Time` types come from those versions.
- `scheduler` 0.1.0.0: pure deadline/FIFO queues, one-shot running tokens and cancellation, and fixed-rate/fixed-delay recurrence with Skip and bounded CatchUp, quantified proofs, a monotonic worker consumer, and standard-library benchmarks.
- `multipart` 0.1.1.1: imports `crypto` 0.2.2.1, so native builds on Bend 2.0.36 compile.
- CI runs Bend 2.0.36.
- `camber` 0.7.0.0: imports `bend-kit-http@0.32.0.0` and requires Bend 2.0.36. `submit` answers the `Chan.send` result, so a failed submit gives back its message. A resource that cannot return to its owner goes to `destroy`. It imports `time` 0.1.2.1, `wire` 0.4.6.1, `files` 0.1.1.1, and `notch` 0.1.0.1, so `Time` and `Wire` match `http` 0.32.0.0 and native builds compile.
- `http` 0.32.0.0: imports `bend-kit-http2@0.2.0.0` and `bend-kit-concurrency@0.2.0.0`, and requires Bend 2.0.36 for the `Result` from `Chan.send`. It imports the effect packages fixed for Bend 2.0.36 (`wire` 0.4.6.1, `dns` 0.6.0.2, `time` 0.1.2.1, `zlib` 0.2.0.1), so native builds compile.
- `multipart` 0.1.1.0: the decoder step `Wait` is now `Pause`, because Base 2.0.36 declares `Wait`.
- `concurrency` 0.2.0.0: requires Bend 2.0.36, where `Chan.send` answers `Result<&1, &1, A, Unit>`. A relay keeps the unsent value in `RSent` instead of a `Bool`.
- `http2` 0.2.0.0: the `Reply` constructor `Ready` is now `Advanced`, because Base 2.0.36 declares `Ready`.
- `postgres` 0.1.0.2 and `redis` 0.1.0.2: import `wire` 0.4.6.1, `dns` 0.6.0.2, and (postgres) `crypto` 0.2.2.1, so native builds on Bend 2.0.36 compile.
- `dns` 0.6.0.2, `archive` 0.2.0.1, `notch` 0.1.0.1, `stream` 0.1.0.1, and `websocket` 0.2.0.1: import the effect packages fixed for Bend 2.0.36 (`wire` 0.4.6.1, `zlib` 0.2.0.1, `time` 0.1.2.1, `files` 0.1.1.1, `crypto` 0.2.2.1), so native builds compile.
- `property` 0.2.0.0: imports `random` 0.1.0.1, so native builds compile. Breaking: `Rand.Rng` comes from that version.
- `llm` 0.2.0.0: `send` retries through `Hairpin.request.as` with llm's own judge (408, 409, 429, 5xx), on one budget per call, instead of its own loop. Breaking: `ErrNet` holds a `Hairpin.Err`.
- `webhooks` 0.2.0.0: `send` retries through `Hairpin.request.as` instead of its own loop. `send.in` delivers inside a caller's retry layer on a shared `Retry.Budget`. Breaking: `SendNet` holds a `Hairpin.Err`. The delivery smoke moved into `check.bend`.
- `sigv4` 0.2.0.0: requests go through `Hairpin.request.as` with `Accept-Encoding: identity`, not Hairpin's internals. Breaking: `ErrNet` holds a `Hairpin.Err`.
- `jwt` 0.2.0.0, `oauth2` 0.2.0.0: on `hairpin` 0.2.1.0. Breaking: `Net` and `ErrNet` hold a `Hairpin.Err`.
- `hairpin` 0.2.1.0: `Hairpin.request.as` takes the retry judge, the idempotency, and the `Accept-Encoding` value from the caller, so an API with its own retry rules keeps the shared budget, deadline, backoff, and breaker. `Hairpin.budget(c)` gives the budget of one plain request.
- `hairpin` 0.2.0.0: a proven retry policy in `retry.bend`: a shared attempt budget across nested layers (`Hairpin.request.in`), operation deadlines (`Hairpin.deadline`), bounded jittered backoff, and a circuit breaker (`Hairpin.circuit`). Breaking: results are `Result<Hairpin.Err, Http.Res>`, where `ErrDenied` says why no attempt started.
- `resources` 0.1.0.0: bounded capacity pools with affine reservations. Reserve, release, split, and combine, with proved conservation laws.
- `http` 0.31.1.1: admission imports `bend-kit-resources@0.1.0.0` from the hub, not a bundled copy.
- `http` 0.31.1.0: admission keeps its connection, active, and buffered counts in `resources` pools. A give with no matching take stops the server instead of wrapping a counter.
- `websocket` 0.2.0.0: frame decoding is `next`, proved on a list model: read boundaries do not change frames, rest, or faults, decoded frames and faults stay fixed, every frame consumes input, payloads obey max, and pending input is bounded. `parse` takes a `Bytes.Cursor` and `push` appends reads, so a frame no longer copies the rest of its read; `Conn.input` is a `Bytes.Cursor`. A 64-bit length of 2^32 or more is rejected even with the largest max.
- `crypto` 0.2.2.1, `dns` 0.6.0.1, `files` 0.1.1.1, `random` 0.1.0.1, `sqlite` 0.1.0.1, `tty` 0.1.0.1, `wire` 0.4.6.1, `zlib` 0.2.0.1, and `time` 0.1.2.1: register C effects with the two-argument `io_eff` of Bend 2.0.36, so native builds that use these packages compile.
- `process` 0.2.0.1: register C effects with the two-argument `io_eff` of Bend 2.0.36 and name them with `CID(...)`. Before, `wait` registered under the runtime's own `CID_WAIT`, so a native `wait` call failed with "an alien request".
- `protobuf` 0.1.0.0: bounded pure proto3 wire codec and a standard `protoc` plugin for typed Bend messages, with unknown fields and published Bytes/F64 types.
- `f64` 0.1.0.0: IEEE 754 binary64 add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Soft-float until Base has `F64`.
- Apache-2.0 license, contributor guide, security policy, and issue templates.
- Local HTTP smokes fail CI. A live fetch failure does not.
