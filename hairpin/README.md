Hairpin is an HTTP client for Bend 2, built on `bend-kit-http`. One `Client` holds a base URL, default headers, a socket pool, a cookie jar, a client certificate, a redirect mode, a step timeout, a retry policy, and a circuit breaker. Each request uses all of them. The model is undici's `Agent` with ky's instance options.

```bend
import bend-kit-hairpin@0.3.0.0/hairpin.bend as Hairpin
import bend-kit-hairpin@0.3.0.0/retry.bend as Retry
import bend-kit-http@0.32.0.0/http.bend as Http
```

Import `bend-kit-http@0.32.0.0`. That is the version `hairpin.bend` imports, and another version has a different `Http.Res`.

Hairpinning, or NAT loopback, is traffic that goes out and bends back. A request does the same.

## Use

```bend
import Base

def api() -> Hairpin.Client:
  c = Hairpin.base(Hairpin.new(), "https://api.example.com/v1/")
  Hairpin.retry(Hairpin.header(c, "Accept", "application/json"), 2)

def done(r: Hairpin.Client & Result<&1, &1, Hairpin.Err, Http.Res>) -> IO(Unit):
  (c, got) = r
  Hairpin.close(c)

def main() -> IO(Unit):
  do IO<Unit>:
    r : Hairpin.Client & Result<&1, &1, Hairpin.Err, Http.Res> <- Hairpin.get(api(), "users/7")
    done(r)
```

A `Client` is affine. Every request returns the client beside the result; pass that client to the next request, and `Hairpin.close` it at the end to close its idle sockets.

The result is `Result<&1, &1, Hairpin.Err, Http.Res>`. `ErrHttp{e}` is the `Http.Err` of the last attempt. `ErrDenied{why}` means that no attempt started: `DenyLate` (the deadline passed), `DenySpent` (the budget is spent), or `DenyOpen` (the circuit is open).

## Options

| call | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `Hairpin.new()` | | 8 idle sockets per origin. `Hairpin.new.with(cap)` sets another cap. |
| `Hairpin.base(c, url)` | none | Each request URL resolves against `url` (RFC 3986 §5.2), so `"users/7"` against `https://api.example.com/v1/` is `https://api.example.com/v1/users/7`. An absolute URL goes as given. With a base that is not an absolute `http` or `https` URL, every request fails with `ErrUrl`. |
| `Hairpin.header(c, k, v)` | none | A default header. A second default of the same name replaces the first. A request header of the same name, in any case, replaces the default. The client sets `Host`, `Connection`, `Content-Length`, and `Transfer-Encoding` itself and drops them from both. |
| `Hairpin.timeout(c, ms)` | 30000 | The step timeout of each connect, write, and read. |
| `Hairpin.redirect(c, mode)` | `Http.ModeFollow{}` | `ModeManual` returns the 3xx; `ModeError` fails with `ErrRedirect`. A chain stops after 20 hops. |
| `Hairpin.retry(c, n)` | 0 | Up to `n` retries: `n + 1` attempts in all. See [Retries](#retries). |
| `Hairpin.deadline(c, ms)` | none | No attempt of a request starts `ms` or more after the request starts. A wait that would reach the deadline ends the request instead. |
| `Hairpin.circuit(c, Retry.Circuit{threshold, window, cooldown, probes})` | none | A circuit breaker in front of every request on this client. See [Circuit breaker](#circuit-breaker). `Hairpin.breaker.of(c)` gives its state back. |
| `Hairpin.cert(c, chain, key)` | none | Paths to a PEM client chain and key for mutual TLS. The identity follows same-origin redirects only, and pooled sockets are kept per identity. |
| `Hairpin.jar(c, jar)` | none | Every hop, redirects and retries included, sends the jar's cookies and stores each `Set-Cookie`. Before each try, the jar's clock moves to `Time.now()`. `Hairpin.jar.of(c)` gives the jar back. |

## Requests

- `Hairpin.request(c, method, url, headers, body)` makes one request. The body is an `Http.Body`.
- `Hairpin.get(c, url)` is a GET with no headers and no body.
- `Hairpin.post.json(c, url, v)` POSTs a `Json.Val` as compact JSON, with `content-type: application/json`.
- `Hairpin.request.in(c, budget, method, url, headers, body)` makes one request inside a caller's retry layer. See [Nested retries](#nested-retries).
- `Hairpin.request.as(~judge, c, budget, idem, enc, method, url, headers, body)` is `request.in` with every choice explicit. See [Your own retry rules](#your-own-retry-rules).
- `Hairpin.budget(c)` gives the budget that one plain `request` gets: the client's `retry` + 1 attempts and its `deadline` from now.

Everything else is `Http.fetch`: IPv6, DNS order, proxies from `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`, HTTP/2 over ALPN, and body decoding of `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, and `zstd`. See [../http/README.md](../http/README.md).

Hairpin does not stream. For a streamed body, use `Http.open` and `Http.upload`. For many requests at once, use `Http.fetch.all`.

## Retries

`retry.bend` is the policy. It is pure; Hairpin reads the clock (`Hairpin.now.ms()`, monotonic milliseconds) and calls it. Each request runs this loop:

1. **Admit.** `Retry.admit(breaker, budget, now)` checks the deadline, then the budget, then the breaker. Only `GateGo` starts an attempt, and it takes one attempt from the budget. A denial before the first attempt is `ErrDenied{why}`; a later denial returns the last result.
2. **Classify.** `Http.retry.judge` reads the result. A connect error, a timeout, and 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504 are transient. Anything else (a success, another status, another error) is `Settled`. A transient failure of GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, or DELETE is `Transient`, with the server's `Retry-After` (at most 30 s). The same failure of any other method is `Unsafe`.
3. **Tell the breaker.** `Unsafe` and `Transient` count as failures. `Settled` counts as a success.
4. **Plan.** `Retry.plan` stops on `Settled` and `Unsafe`. On `Transient` it waits `Retry-After`, or a backoff of 500 ms doubled per retry up to 30 s, with equal jitter (a wait in `[d/2, d]`). It stops when the budget is spent or when the wait would reach the deadline.

The policy is `Retry.Policy{attempts, base, cap, deadline}`. `Hairpin.retry` sets `attempts`, and `Hairpin.deadline` sets `deadline`.

A retry repeats the request. Hairpin retries only methods that RFC 9110 calls idempotent. That does not make a server's handler safe to repeat: a PUT with side effects is retried too.

## Nested retries

A caller with its own retry loop (an SDK above Hairpin, a job runner) multiplies attempts: 3 outer tries of 3 inner attempts are 9 requests. A shared `Retry.Budget` stops that. Make one budget for the whole operation, pass it to each `Hairpin.request.in`, and pass the budget that comes back to the next call:

```bend
def call(x: Hairpin.Client & Retry.Budget) -> IO(Hairpin.Client & Retry.Budget & Result<&1, &1, Hairpin.Err, Http.Res>):
  (c, b) = x
  Hairpin.request.in(c, b, "GET", "jobs/7", Http.empty(), Bytes.new(0))

def start(c: Hairpin.Client) -> IO(Hairpin.Client & Retry.Budget & Result<&1, &1, Hairpin.Err, Http.Res>):
  do IO<Hairpin.Client & Retry.Budget & Result<&1, &1, Hairpin.Err, Http.Res>>:
    now : Nat <- Hairpin.now.ms()
    call((c, Retry.Budget.new(4n, now, Some{2000n})))
```

Every attempt of every call takes from the one budget and obeys its deadline. The client's `retry` setting still caps the attempts of each call; the client's `deadline` does not apply, because the budget carries its own. `Retry.Budget` is a plain value, so a layer can build a fresh one. Do not: a layer that builds its own budget resets the count.

## Your own retry rules

`request.in` retries only what `Http.retry.judge` calls transient, and only for an idempotent method. An API with other rules, such as Anthropic's 529 or a POST that the server deduplicates, uses `request.as`:

- `~judge` takes the result of one attempt. It returns the result and `Some{Retry-After}` when another attempt may help (`Some{""}` for no header), or `None{}`. `Hairpin.judge` is the default.
- `idem` says that the request is safe to repeat. When it is `False{}`, a judged failure counts against the breaker but never repeats.
- `enc` is the `Accept-Encoding` value. `Http.codings()` gives every coding that Http decodes. `"identity"` leaves the body as the server sent it.

The budget, the deadline, the backoff, and the breaker apply as for `request.in`.

## Circuit breaker

`Retry.Circuit{threshold, window, cooldown, probes}` sets the breaker:

- **Closed** admits every attempt. `threshold` failures in a row, each inside `window` ms of the newest, open it. A success clears the count.
- **Open** admits nothing for `cooldown` ms. An attempt that was already running and ends now changes nothing.
- **Half-open** begins at the first admission after the cooldown. It admits at most `probes` attempts at once. A probe success closes the circuit; a probe failure opens it for another `cooldown`.

A `Client` has one breaker for all origins. Requests on one client are sequential, so at most one probe is in flight; the `probes` limit matters to a caller that shares a breaker across fibers.

## Guarantees

[SPEC.md](SPEC.md) lists the proven claims and the trust assumptions.

## Checks

`check.bend` runs a local server that accepts exactly one connection per scripted response and then stops listening, so each scenario counts its attempts: a missing attempt times out, and an extra one finds no listener. It checks a redirect that sets a cookie, a 503 retried to a 200, a POST 503 tried once, a 302 in manual mode, 3 attempts for `retry 2`, one attempt for a 404, a deadline that stops after 2 of 6 attempts and one that denies the first, a breaker that opens after 2 failures, denies, and closes after one probe, three nested calls that share a budget of 4: 3 attempts, then 1, then none, and a `request.as` judge that retries an idempotent POST through two 404s.
